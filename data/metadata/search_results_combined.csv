A026,"(2021) Volume 2, Issue 4 Cultural Implications of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC Authors:	 Dr. Unsa Jamshed Amar Jahangir Anbrin Khawaja Abstract:	This study is an attempt to highlight the cultural implication of CPEC on Pak-China relations, how it will align two nations culturally, and what steps were taken by the governments of two states to bring the people closer. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China, the cultural aspect of relations between the two states also moved forward. The flow of cultural delegations intensified after the 2010, because this year was celebrated as the ‘Pak-China Friendship Year’. This dimension of relations further cemented between the two states with the signing of CPEC in April 2015. CPEC will not only bring economic prosperity in Pakistan but it will also bring two states culturally closer. The roads and other communication link under this project will become source of cultural flow between the two states.

In this perspective, political figures frequently use twitter to highlight their political as well as personal lives worldwide. However, political figures take the stardom status among the twitter audience that follow, retweet and comment by their fans. The purpose of this study is, to analyze what kind of language, level of interest is made by political figures while communicating via twitter, text, phrases and languages used by political figures, and do their tweets contribute in their reputation. The qualitative content analysis is used for evaluation of the interests shared by PM Imran Khan, PM Boris John Son and PM Narendra Modi with the key words of tweets. A well-established coding sheet is developed for the analysis of text, phrases and words in the frames of negative, positive and neutral from March 2020 to May 2020. The results are demonstrating on the basis of content shared by Prime Ministers of three countries i.e., From Pakistan, Imran Khan, United Kingdom, Johnson Boris and India, Narendra Modi on twitter. The findings also reveal that varied issues discussed in tweets, significantly positive and neutral words are selected by these political figures. PM Imran tweeted more negative tweets than PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi. However, PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi make significant positive and neutral tweets. It is observed that political figures are conscious about their personal reputation while tweeting. It also revealed that the issues and tweets shared by these leaders contribute to their personal reputation.

However, this relationship becomes more questionable when policy uncertainty is added in it. Hence, this paper presents evidence on the effect of government size on economic growth in the presence of budget uncertainty measured through three different approaches. Rather than relying on the traditional and complicated measures of uncertainty, a new method of measuring uncertainty based on government budget revisions of total spending is introduced and compared with the other competing approaches. Using time series annual data from 1973-2018, the short run and long run coefficients from Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) framework validate the negative effect of budget uncertainty and government size on economic growth of Pakistan regardless of the uncertainty measure used. Therefore, to attain the long run economic growth, along with the control on the share of government spending in total GDP, government should keep the revisions in the budget as close to the initial announcements as it can so that uncertainty can be reduced. Further, the uncertainty in fiscal spending calculated through the deviation method raises a big question on the credibility of fiscal policy in Pakistan. Higher will be the deviation higher will be the uncertainty and lower the fiscal policy credibility hence making fiscal policy less effective in the long run.

The paper argues that The Alchemist is a cynical and despairing play created in an atmosphere not suitable for a comedy. This is a qualitative study of the text and aims at an analysis of the theme, situations, characters, language, and the mood of the play to determine that Jonson is unable to retain the comic spirit in The Alchemist and in an attempt to “better men” (Prologue. 12) he becomes more satirical and less humorous or comic. This research is important for it contends that the play, termed as a comedy, may be read as a bitter satire on the cynical, stinky, and despairing world of the Elizabethan times.

With the application of containment Policy, the U.S. achieved much success in international politics. Over time China has become more powerful and sees great power in international politics. China wants to expand and launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The primary purpose of The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is to achieve support from regional countries and save their interests from the U.S. In 2017, the American administration launched its Containment policy through Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad) to keep their interest from China. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) is comprising of Australia, the United States, Japan, and India. This Study is based on Qualitative research with theoretical application of Game theory. This research investigates both plans of China (BRI) and the U.S. (the Quad) through a Game Theory. In this study, China and the U.S. both like to act as gamers in international politics. This study recommends that Game theory can predict all developments in the long term.

The Prince is the book of Niccolo Machiavelli a great philosopher of his time. If Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi qualifies as a Prince of Machiavelli is a very important question. This is answered in the light of his policies and strategies to become the undisputed political leader of India. Much of the Machiavellian Prince deals with the problem of how a layman can raise himself from abject and obscure origins to such a position that Narendra Modi has been holding in India since 2014. The basic theme of this article is revolving around the question that is following: Can Modi’s success be attributed to techniques of The Prince in important respects? This article analyzed Narendra Modi's policies and strategies to develop an analogy between Machiavellian Prince and Modi in terms of characteristics and political strategies. This research work examines, how Narendra Modi became the strongest person in India.

This Lyotardian paradigm extends a subversive challenge to all the grand narratives that have been enjoying the status of an enviable complete code of life in the world for a long time. Even a cursory scan over the play under analysis creates a strong feel that Beckett very smartly, comprehensively and successfully questioned the relevance of the totalizing metanarratives to the present times. Being an imaginative writer, he was well aware of the fact that ridicule is a much more useful weapon than satire in the context of political literature. There are so many foundationalist ideologies that he ridicules in his dramatic writing. Christianity as a religion is well exposed; the gravity of philosophy is devalued; the traditional luxury that the humans get from the art of poetry is ruptured and the great ideals of struggle are punctured. He achieves his artistic and ideologically evolved authorial intentions with a ringing success. It is interesting to note that he maintains a healthy balance between art and message.

Current study was quantitative in nature. All elementary level enrolled students at government schools in the province of the Punjab made the population of the study. Multistage sampling was used to select the sample from four districts of one division (Sargodha) of the Punjab province i.e., Sargodha. A sample size i.e., n=960; students and their parents were participated in this study. Research scales i.e. Parenting Styles Dimension Questionnaire (PSDQ) was adapted to analyze and measure parents’ parenting styles and an achievement test was developed to measure the academic achievement of the elementary students. After pilot testing, reliability coefficient Cronbach Alpha values for PSDQ and achievement test were 0.67 and 0.71 Data was collected and analyzed using frequencies count, percentages, mean scores and one way ANOVA. Major findings of the study were; Majority of the parents had authoritative parental style, a handsome number of parents keep connection of warmth and support with their children, show intimacy, focus on discipline, do not grant autonomy to their children, do not indulge with their children and as well as a handsome number of students were confident during their studies and study, further, found that parental style had positive relationship with academic achievement. Recommendations were made on the basis of findings and conclusion such as arrangement of Parents Teachers Meetings (PTM‘s), parents’ training, provision of incentives and facilities to motivate families might be an inclusive component of elementary education program.

Kashmir is the unfinished agenda of partition and a stumbling block in the bilateral relations between Pakistan and India. After the partition of sub-continent in 1947, Pakistan and India got their sovereign status. Kashmir conflict, a disputed status state, is the byproduct of partition. Pakistan and India are traditional arch-foes. Any clash between Pakistan and India can bring the two nuclear states toe-to-toe and accelerate into nuclear warfare. Due to the revulsion, hostility and lack of trust between the two, the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue has been long overdue. Ever-increasing border spats, arms race and threat of terrorism between the two have augmented anxiety in the subcontinent along with the halt of talks between India and Pakistan at several times. Additionally, it hampers the economic and trade ties between the two. India, time and again, backtracked on Kashmir issue despite UN efforts to resolve the issue. Recently, Indian government has responded heavy-handedly to the Kashmiri agitators’ demand for sovereignty and revocation of ‘Special Status’ of Kashmir impacting the stability of the region in future.

Data comprises the official discourse which is used in diplomatic affairs of both the states. The extensive investigation seeks insights from the fundamentals of Critical Discourse Analysis propounded by van Dijk, Fairclough and Wodak with a special focus on Bhatia’s (2006) work. The study reveals that the image of China has always been accorded priority within Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourse even though nature of bilateral relations among China, India and Pakistan is based on entirely different dynamics; Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourses are reflective of sensitivities involved within the bilateral relations. Through employment of linguistic techniques of ‘positivity’, ‘evasion’ and ‘influence and power’, Indian diplomats have managed not to compromise over the fundamentals in bilateral relations with China despite Pakistan’s already strengthened and deep-rooted relations with China. While Pakistani diplomatic fronts have been equally successful in further deepening their already strengthened relations in the midst of surging controversies on CPEC, BRI and OBOR. Hence, diplomatic fronts of both the counties, through employment of ideologically loaded linguistic choices, leave no stone unturned in consolidation of the diplomatic relations with China.

All the students from two years master (M.A) degree programme and four years (BS) degree programme of eight departments from International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI), Faculty of Social Sciences were taken as a population of the study. 475 students were randomly selected as a sample of the study. The Academic Advising Inventory (AAI) was used to assess Academic Advising Style. For measuring level of the satisfaction, descriptive statistics was used. To compare the mean difference department-wise and gender-wise about academic advising satisfaction t.test was applied. It was concluded that from the major findings of the study those students who received departmental academic advising style are more satisfied as compared to those students who provided prescriptive academic advising style. Female students seemed more satisfied as compared to male students regarding the academic advising style provided to them. Students who satisfied from developmental academic advising style and they were also highly satisfied from the advising provided to them at Personalizing Education (PE) and this is the subscale of developmental academic advising whereas students who received prescriptive academic advising they were also satisfied from the advising provided to them regarding personalizing education and academic decision making but their percentage is less. It is recommended to Universities Administration to focus on Developmental Academic Advising Style and establish centers at universities/department level and nominate staff who may be responsible to provide developmental academic advising.

The study revealed the significant differences in perception of students. Study showed that both genders perceived that female students get more harassed than male students. The factors that affect the perception frequently were gender and age. The findings recommended that regulations for sexual harassment should be implemented in universities; laws should be made for sexual harassment in higher education institutes. Students should be aware of sexual harassment through seminars, self-defense classes and awareness campaigns. And every institute should have a counseling center for the better mental health of students.

The shift in average temperature is putting negative impacts on human health, food production and the natural resources. In the wake of the altered climate, water flow in the river systems is experiencing variability and uncertainty. This paper aims at studying the negative impacts of climate change on the water resources of the Indus Basin and investigate the prospects of cooperation between India and Pakistan; two major riparian nations sharing the basin. Adopting the case study approach, a theoretical framework has been built on the ‘Theory of the International Regimes’. It has been argued that institutional capacity and the dispute resolution mechanism provided in any water sharing agreement determine the extent of cooperation among the member states. Since India and Pakistan are bound by the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty, this study tries to assess the effectiveness of this agreement in managing the negative consequences of the climate change.

This needs a valid and reliable measure to assess the differentiation of self particularly in a relationship with parents. Behavior\Emotional Reactivity Index is such a tool that fulfills this purpose. The present study was carried out to culturaly adapt and translate BERI into the Urdu language and establish the psychometric properties of Urdu version. A sample of 303 adolescents of age (M = 16.07, SD = 1.77) was taken from different schools and colleges. Scale was split into Mother and father forms for the convenience of respondents. Findings supported the original factor structure of the BERI-original version. Higher-order factor analysis showed good fit indices with excellent alpha ranges (α= .91 to α=.80). BERI scores were compared for the adolescents who were securely attached with parents and insecurely attached with parents which showed a significant difference between the groups. BERI-Urdu version was found to be a valid and reliable measure in the Pakistani cultural context which gives researchers new directions to work with adolescents.

One point of view is that for society to flourish, man needs to be repressed. But to what extent is repression necessary for societies to rise and survive? This paper shall examine the above given questions from the standpoint of two thinkers who greatly influenced twentieth-century thought: Sigmund Freud and Herbert Marcuse. To undertake this task, first the term Repression shall be examined and then the notions of Freud and Marcuse will be discussed to determine the degree of repression required for the development of modern society.

The boundaries of geographies play a significant role in shaping fates, biographies, social superstructures and shared collective histories of its residents. Considering this, Henri Lefebvre and Edward William Soja, argue that space is something which determines the living circumstances within the particular social framework and instigates and controls various societal happenings. City space of Karachi suffers from appalling distortions as a part of postmodern, globalized and capitalist world. By employing Lefebvre’s idea of spatial triad and Soja’s views of the trialectrics of spaciality, this paper foregrounds how social space enforces spatial injustice and serves for the inculcation of spatial cleansing in the lives of inhabitants of urban space. Using Shamsie’s Kartography as an interpretive tool for contemporary urban environment, this paper inquires the engrafting of spatial cleansing in the lives of Karachiites resulting in multiple standardization and segregation on the basis of living standards among different social strata. This research substantiates how in Kartography, Materialism nibbles the roots of social values and norms while sequentially administering Spatial Injustice in the lives of Karachiites. This paper proclaims the scarcity of execution of Spatial Justice in the lives of common people in this postmodern globalized capitalist era. This paper urges the possibility of a utopian urban space with enforced spatial justice where people can be saved from dilemmas of injustice and segregation, especially Karachiites.

The entire Middle East region is fraught with tensions, conflicts, civil wars and rivalries. From strategic interests to power grabbing, sectarian divisions, flaws in the civil and social structure of the state and society, ethnic insurrections, and many other shapes of instability syndromes can be diagnosed in this region. In the post-Arab Spring, 2011, the emerging new regional hierarchical order for power/dominance, in addition to the weakening/declining dominant US power in the region, changed the entire shape of already conflict-ridden region. New weak or collapsing states and bifurcation of the ‘status quo’ and ‘counter-hegemonic’ states along with their respective allies, made this region a prototype of instability in the regional security complex of the Middle East, as a direct result of these developments. The perpetuation of these abnormalities would not recede this instability conundrum from the region, provoking third party intervention, if not contained.

The study concludes that the unaccusative verbs only project an internal argument. It does not require the event argument. However, the said verb can be causativised by adding external argument and at the same time the event argument gets included in the valency of the derived causative of the unaccusative root. The unergative, on the other hand, requires an external argument as an obligatory argument while the internal argument is not the obligatory argument of the verb. The event argument is also a part of the valency of the verb. The APFs require one argument which is the internal argument of the verb. However, since the external argument is not available, the internal argument of the verb gets realized as the subject of the verb. The verb does not project event argument. The ergative predicates are derived by the suppression of the external argument and by the externalization of the internal argument.

Unlike Europe in South Asia security dilemma, proxy warfare and nuclear arms race are consistent features of the regional politics. The identity of Pakistan as security-centric state gives its army disproportional power, which created institutional imbalance that directly affected constitutionalism in the country. The constitution of Pakistan is based on principles of civilian supremacy and separation of power but in reality Pakistan’s army is the most powerful institution in country. This paper argues that the structure of Pakistani politics; created institutional imbalances by the disproportionate distribution of resources is the key variable in creating dichotomy.

In this study six growth models have been used for analyzing the main determinants of economic growth in case of cross countries, therefore by using these six models we have tested them for non-nested and nested encompassing through Cox test and F-test respectively. Data from 1980 to 2020 were used to analyze the cross country growth factors so therefore, the current study looked at about forty four countries with modelling these different comparative studies based on growth modelling. So, we can make these six individual models and we can estimate the General Unrestricted Model with the use of econometric technique of Non-Nested Encompassing. By evaluating the data using the Non-Nested Encompassing econometric technique, different sets of economic variables has been used to evaluate which sets of the economic variables are important to boost up the growth level of the country.

Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was adopted as a theoretical framework. A total of 250 young consumers in the two cities of Southern Punjab, Pakistan was randomly sampled and data were collected via a face-to-face survey method. Partial least square technique was employed to test the model. The results showed that attitude towards organic food purchasing motivated when moral norms were activated to consume organic food products. Further, environmental knowledge moderated the relationship of organic food purchase intentions and behaviour significantly. The findings highlighted the importance of moral norms as a meaningful antecedent that could increase the TP-based psychosocial processes if consumers have sufficient environmental knowledge. Therefore, farmers, organic products marketers, government administrators, and food retailers should take initiatives not only to highlight the norms and values but also when promoting organic food production and consumption.

The study under research examines the perspectives of two similar groups of the final year students of at Higher Education Institutions of Pakistan. The first group consists of art students who received the Urdu medium of instruction (UMI), and the second group received the English medium of instruction (EMI). An empirical methodology was carried out in the present year, students answered questionnaires to find out the benefits and challenges of learning subject-based knowledge, what subject-based knowledge means to them, and their understanding of language as a teaching language. Interviews were conducted with the selected group of students who wished to participate in research. Additional information is available from the tests and results obtained in the two equivalent courses. Although many similarities have been identified between the two groups, the overall knowledge of disciplinary knowledge of English medium instruction students was not very effective, while that of UMI students was very effective.

Ecofeminism critiques masculine dominance highlighting its role in creating and perpetuating gender discrimination, social inequity and environmental degradation. Women suffer more because of power disparity in society. Environmental crises affect women more than men because of their already precarious existence and subaltern position. There is affinity between women and nature are victims of climate change and other environmental hazards. Cheryl Glotfelty introduced interdisciplinary approach to the study of literature and environment. Literary ecology as an emerging discipline explores the intriguing relationship between environment and literature. Ecofeminism draws on feminist critique of gender inequality showing how gender categories inscribed in power structure exploit both women and nature. Francoise d‘Eaubonne coined the term ecofeminism to critique the prevalent exploitation of both women and environment. Ecofeminism asserts that exploitation of women and degradation of the environment are the direct result of male dominance and capitalism. Ecofeminism argues for redressing the plight of women and protection of environment. Vonnegut’s play ‘Happy Birthday Wanda June’ was written at a time when the movement for the right of women and protection of environment were gaining momentum. The play shows how toxic masculinity rooted in power and capitalism exploit both women and environment.

The Quran claims that it is a book which explains every situation; therefore, the aim of this study remained to extract those verses of Surah Al-Baqarah which can guide us in Economics. The authentic and approved Islamic clerics and their translations were consulted for the interpretations of the Holy verses. The researchers chiefly focused and studied Surah Baqarah with regards to social equity and economic opportunities. The translations were primarily in the regional language Urdu so the interpretations must not be related exactly equitable in English. The study engaged the document analysis research strategy. This study is only an endeavour to decipher Holy Quran’s message from Allah for the mankind so it must not be considered as the full and complete solution to the all the economic issues, challenges and opportunities. Ahadees and the saying of the Holy prophet were referred to where ever required and available. The researcher also considered the Tafasir (detail intellectual interpretations) of the Quran done by the well-known scholars of Islam for the verses studied therein and any statements and/or material - such as ideas, studies, articles, documentation, data, reports, facts, statistics etc. For the study, data was collected and analyzed qualitatively. On the basis of the study, recommendations were also primed.

Understanding qawwali context requires comprehension of semantics or process of meaning creation and meaning sharing among the qawwal party and the audience. This interactive activity might frequently be hindered when interrupted by subjective meanings creation during cultural consumption. Qawwali is a cultural tradition, its semantics are conditioned by axiological premises of poetry and perceptions which are transforming. The previous researches revealed that qawwali is associated with religion which provides the religious message by singing hamd and naat. It was a means to experience Divine; therefore, semantics are multi-layered and often crossroad with values and subjective experiences. It is novel due to its ritual of Sama. It has the therapeutic power that helps mentally disturbed people and they find refuge. This study is exploratory having a small sample size of twenty purposively selected audiences. This phenomenological inquiry used ethnographic method of conversational interviews at selected shrines and cultural spaces in Islamabad. The results indicate that qawwali is a strong refuge for people facing miseries of life and they attend Sama with a belief that attending and listening will consequently resolve their issues, either psychological or physiological. They participate in Sama which teaches them how to be optimistic in a negative situation; this paper brings forth this nodal phenomenon using the verbatim explanations by the interlocutors. Semantics of Qawwali are conditioned and some of these elements are highlighted including poetry and axiology based perceptions and cultural consumption of a cultural realm.

The natives are majorly involved in illegal transportation of goods and objects, therefore; the study sets to explain how significant smuggling for the local people is. It describes the kinship role in reciprocity of their trade and transportation. The qualitative methods such as purposive sampling and interview guide were employed for data collection. The research findings revealed that local people were satisfied with their illegal trading which is depended largely on their expertise and know-how of smuggling at borders. They disclosed that their total economy was predominantly based on smuggling of stuff like drugs, diesel, oil, gas, petrol, ration food from Iran, and human trafficking. They also enjoyed the privilege of possessing Sajjil (Iranian identity card), thus; the dual nationality helped them in their daily business and rahdari (border crossing agreement), enabling them to travel to Iran for multiple purposes.

The Kafkaesque is characterised by the following: World is a huge forking labyrinthine institution where the man has been thrown to suffer its complexities, confrontation with the labyrinth makes his existence meaningless because freedom is a taboo in no man’s land, he is punished for an unknown sin for which he seeks justification from the superior authorities, but his efforts are viewed as ludicrous or comic despite the underlying sense of tragedy. (5) The Kafkaesque tendency to present tragic situation comically is also explored in Abe’s novel. The paper studies the effect of higher authorities exercising their power over man and the inscrutability of cosmic structures continuously undermining human freedom in nightmarish conditions. The paper establishes Kobo Abe in the literary world as a writer who portrays the hollowness and futility of human lives with a Kafkaesque touch.

Althusser believes that ideology is a belief system of a society in which ideological agencies establish hierarchies in society through reinforcement and discrimination for cultural conditioning. These agencies function through ideological state apparatuses. These ideological agencies help to construct individual identity in society. The undesirable ideologies promote repressive political agendas. The non-repressive ideologies are inhaled by the individuals as a natural way of looking at the culture and society. This research seeks to investigate Omar Shahid Hamid’s novel The Spinners Tales through the lens of Althusser’s ideology and interpellation. This study examines how the characters of Shahid’s novel inhaled ideology and became its subjects. This research also depicts the alarming effects of cultural hegemony that creates cultural infidelity and hierarchies between the bourgeoisie and proletariat classes.

It controlled the Indian education field till the establishment of Indian Education Commission, 1882. The Despatch provided space to Christian missionaries by promising government’s gradual withdrawal from the education in favour of missionaries. It also facilitated the missionaries by offering system of ‘grants on aid’ to the private bodies. Consequently, the missionaries fancied to replace the government institutions in the Punjab and initiated their efforts to increase the number of their educational institutions. They tried to occupy the educational field by establishing more and more educational institutions. But after the Recommendations of the Indian Education Commission 1882, a change in their policy of numeric increase of educational institutions is quite visible. With the turn of the century, they are found to be eager to establish a few institutions with good quality of education. This paper intends to analyse different factors behind the change of their policy of quantitative dominance to qualitative improvement. It also attempts to evaluate how their change of policy worked and what steps were taken to improve the quality of their educational institutions. Following the historical method qualitative data comprising educational reports, missionaries’ autobiographies, Reports of missionaries’ conferences, and the other relevant primary and secondary sources has been collected from different repositories. The analysis of the data suggests that the attitude of the administration of the education department and the recommendations of Indian Education Commission were the major driving forces behind the change of missionaries’ educational policy in the 20th century. The missionaries, after adopting the new policy, worked on the quality of education in their institutions and became successful.

Daughters became curses and liability for parents causing serious consequences. For control, there are legal ban/restrictions (Dowry and Wedding Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976; Amendment in Act, 1993) on its practice in Pakistan. Despite the legal cover, the custom has been extended. Dowry amount seems to be increasing due to changing lifestyle and trends of society. To understand males’ and females’ perceptions about dowry; impacts of dowry; why dowry is essential; and how it is affecting women’s rights and eventually affecting women’s autonomy. A qualitative study was conducted. Data was collected by using unstructured interviews from males and females including social activists, economists, and married couples about wedding expenses, demands, society pressure, men’s support, and perception against dowry especially with regards to women’s rights and autonomy. The study concluded heavy dowry especially in terms of furniture, electronics, kitchenware, car, furnished houses, and cash highly associated with women’s development and their rights. General people’s perception showed that dowry is no longer remained a custom or tradition in Asian countries. It is just a trend and people follow it as a symbol of respect for parents and women as well.

Lack of capacity and poor standards of governance caused nontraditional security challenges to Pakistan too. The NCOC is the central nerve center to guide the national response to COVID-19 by Pakistan and can be best analyzed in the light of the decision-making theory of Naturalist Decision Making (NDM). The study points out the effective role performed by NCOC at policy formation through a more prosaic combination of science, data, decision making and execution of decisions at the level of federalism. The study highlights the changing patterns of government’s approach during the pandemic at various levels. Pakistan faced economic, political and social crisis during this phase. This study uses a survey and key informant interviews as the source of analysis for qualitative data collection. By applying the decision- making theory, the paper extends that there is a need to use a model to balance the existing gap within the system, to meet challenges. The study suggests a coordinating approach among various units and center; that might raise the level of performance to meet the nontraditional security challenges with innovation, creativity and boldness.

Judicial review is a remedy provided by the public law and is exercised by the superior and higher courts to supervise administrative authorities' powers and functions. The main objective of the judicial review is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of individuals by public authorities. The ground of the judicial review, i.e., Unreasonableness or irrationality or popularly known as Wednesbury Unreasonableness was introduced by lord Greene in the Wednesbury Corporation case in 1948. Initially, the scope of this ground of judicial review was very narrow and was allowed only in rare cases. However, with the development of administrative law and Human rights, it also developed. Its development resulted in different controversies and issues about the application of this ground. The main issue is about its encroachment in the jurisdiction of other branches of the government i.e., the parliament and executive. The free and loose application of this principle results in confusion and conflict between different organs of the government. The present paper is based on the implications of the limitations on the ground of Wednesbury Unreasonableness both on the judicial and administrative bodies in Pakistan to avoid the chaos and confusion that results in the criticisms on this ground of judicial review.

Therefore, the problem of rational use of natural resources, in particular protection of early spring plant species is very important. However, literary sources analysis only reveals data on the biology of species of this genus.  The present research,conducted in the spring of 2017-2019, focuses on anatomical and morphological features of two Altai species: Gagealutea and Gagea minima; these features were studied, clarified and confirmed by drawings and photographs. The anatomical structure of the stem and leaf blade was studied in detail.  The obtained research results will prove useful for studies of medicinal raw materials and honey plants.  The aforementioned species are similar in morphological features, yet G. minima issmaller in size, and its shoots appear earlier than those of other species Keywords: Flora,gageas,Altai species,vegetative organs., Refference:  I.

Voropaeva,Viktoriay A. Kolomytseva, DOI: https://doi.org/10.26782/jmcms.spl.10/2020.06.00042	 Abstract:  This study was aimed at examining the influence of succession cropping on the economic efficiency of no-till field crop rotations on the black earth in the zone of unstable moistening of the Stavropol krai. A long-term stationary experiment was conducted to examine for the purpose nine field crop rotation patterns different in the number of fields (four to six), set of crops, and their succession in crop rotation. The respective shares of legumes, oilseeds, and cereals in the cropping pattern were 17 to 33, 17 to 40, and 50 to 67 %. It has been established that in case of no-till field crop cultivation the economic efficiency of plant production depends on the set of crops and their succession in rotation. The most economically efficient type of crop rotation is the soya-winter wheat-peas-winter wheat-sunflower-corn six-field rotation with two fields of legumes: in this rotation 1 ha of crop rotation area yields 3 850 grain units per ha at a grain unit prime cost of 5.46 roubles; the plant production output return and profitability were 20,888 roubles per ha and 113 %, respectively. The high production profitabilities provided by the soya-winter wheat-sunflower four-field and the soya-winter-wheat-sunflower-corn-winter wheat five-field crop rotation are 108.7 and 106.2 %, respectively. The inclusion of winter wheat in crop rotation for two years in a row reduces the second winter wheat crop yield by 80 to 100 %, which means a certain reduction in the grain unit harvesting rate to 3.48-3.57 thousands per ha of rotation area and cuts the production profitability down to 84.4-92.3 %. This is why, no-till cropping should not include winter wheat for a second time Keywords: No-till technology,crop rotation,predecessor,yield,return,profitability, Refference:  I Badakhova G.

View | Download DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF AUTONOMOUS PORTABLE SEISMOMETER DESIGNED FOR USE AT ULTRALOW TEMPERATURES IN ARCTIC ENVIRONMENT Authors: Mikhail A. Abaturov,Yuriy V. Sirotinskiy, DOI: https://doi.org/10.26782/jmcms.spl.10/2020.06.00043	 Abstract:  This paper is concerned with solving one of the issues of the general problem of designing geophysical equipment for the natural climatic environment of the Arctic. The relevance of the topic has to do with an increased global interest in this region. The paper is aimed at considering the basic principles of developing and the procedure of testing seismic instruments for use at ultralow climatic temperatures. In this paper the indicated issue is considered through the example of a seismic module designed for petroleum and gas exploration by passive seismoacoustic methods. The seismic module is a direct-burial portable unit of around 5 kg in weight, designed to continuously measure and record microseismic triaxial orthogonal (ZNE) noise in a range from 0.1 to 45 Hz during several days in autonomous mode.  The functional chart of designing the seismic module was considered, and concrete conclusions were made for choosing the necessary components to meet the ultralow-temperature operational requirements. The conclusions made served for developing appropriate seismic module. In this case, the components and tools used included a SAFT MP 176065 xc low-temperature lithium cell, industrial-spec electronic component parts, a Zhaofeng Geophysical ZF-4.5 Chinese primary electrodynamic seismic sensor, housing seal parts made of frost-resistant silicone materials, and finely dispersed silica gel used as water-retaining sorbent to avoid condensation in the housing.  The paper also describes a procedure of low-temperature collation tests at the lab using a New Brunswick Scientific freezing plant. The test results proved the operability of the developed equipment at ultralow temperatures down to -55°C. In addition, tests were conducted at low microseismic noises in the actual Arctic environment. The possibility to detect signals in a range from 1 to 10 Hz at the level close to the NLNM limit (the Peterson model) has been confirmed, which allows monitoring and exploring petroleum and gas deposits by passive methods.  As revealed by this study, the suggested approaches are efficient in developing high-precision mobile seismic instruments for use at ultralow climatic temperatures. The solution of the considered instrumentation and methodical issues is of great practical significance as a constituent of the generic problem of Arctic exploration.

View | Download COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH FOOT PATHOLOGY WHO UNDERWENT WEIL OPEN OSTEOTOMY BY CLASSICAL METHOD AND WITHOUT STEOSYNTHESIS Authors: Yuriy V. Lartsev,Dmitrii A. Rasputin,Sergey D. Zuev-Ratnikov,Pavel V.Ryzhov,Dmitry S. Kudashev,Anton A. Bogdanov, DOI: https://doi.org/10.26782/jmcms.spl.10/2020.06.00044	 Abstract:  The article considers the problem of surgical correction of the second metatarsal bone length. The article analyzes the results of treatment of patients with excess length of the second metatarsal bones that underwent osteotomy with and without osteosynthesis. The results of treatment of patients who underwent metatarsal shortening due to classical Weil-osteotomy with and without osteosynthesis were analyzed. The first group consisted of 34 patients. They underwent classical Weil osteotomy. The second group included 44 patients in whomosteotomy of the second metatarsal bone were not by the screw. When studying the results of the treatment in the immediate postoperative period, weeks 6, 12, slightly better results were observed in patients of the first group, while one year after surgical treatment the results in both groups were comparable. One year after surgical treatment, there were 2.9% (1 patient) of unsatisfactory results in the first group and 4.5% (2 patients) in the second group. Considering the comparability of the results of treatment in remote postoperative period, the choice of concrete method remains with the operating surgeon.

Methods. A prospective 3-year study of 86 healthy dogs (aged 1-7 yrs) of different breeds and of both sexes. Echo homogeneity and echogenicity of the stomach and intestines wall were determined by the method of Silina, T.L., et al. (2010) in absolute values ​​of average brightness levels of ultrasound image pixels using the 8-bit scale with 256 shades of gray.  Results. Quantitative echogenicity indicators of the stomach and the small intestine wall in dogs were determined. Based on the numerical values ​​characterizing echogenicity distribution in each layer of a separate structure of the digestive system, the coefficient of gastric echogenicity is determined as 1:2.4:1.1 (mucosa/submucosa/muscle layers, respectively), the coefficient of duodenum and jejunum echogenicity is determined as 1:3.5:2 and that of ileum is 1:1.8:1.  Clinical significance. The echogenicity coefficient of the wall of the digestive system allows an objective assessment of the stomach and intestines wall and can serve as the basis for a quantitative assessment of echogenicity changes for various pathologies of the digestive system Keywords: Ultrasound (US),echogenicity,echogenicity coefficient,digestive system,dogs,stomach,intestines, Refference:  I.

When studying the temporal organization of physiological functions, the rhythm parameters of physiological functions were determined, followed by processing the results using the Cosinor Analysis program, which reveals rhythms with an unknown period for unequal observations, evaluates 5 parameters of sinusoidal rhythms (mesor, amplitude, acrophase, period, reliability). The essence of desynchronization is the mismatch of circadian rhythms among themselves or destruction of the rhythms architectonics (instability of acrophases or their disappearance). Desynchronization  with respect to the rhythmic structure of the body is of a disregulatory nature, most pronounced in pathological desynchronization. High neurotism, increased anxiety reinforces the tendency to internal desynchronization, which increases with stress. During examination stress, students experience a decrease in the stability of the temporary organization of the biosystem and the tension of adaptive mechanisms develops, which affects attention, mental performance and the quality of adaptation to the educational process. Time is shortened and the amplitude of the “initial minute” decreases, personal and situational anxiety develops, and the level of psychophysiological adaptation decreases. The results of the work are priority because they can be used in assessing quality and level of health.

Tsvetkov, DOI: https://doi.org/10.26782/jmcms.spl.10/2020.06.00047	 Abstract:  The present study of comparison methods based on the triadic model introduces the following concepts: the relation of comparability and the relation of comparison, and object comparison and attributive comparison. The difference between active and passive qualitative comparison is shown, two triadic models of passive and active comparison and models for comparing two and three objects are described. Triadic comparison models are proposed as an alternative to dyadic comparison models. Comparison allows finding the common and the different; this approach is proposed for the analysis of the nomothetic and ideographic method of obtaining knowledge. The nomothetic method identifies and evaluates the general, while the ideographic method searches for unique in parameters and in combinations of parameters. Triadic comparison is used in systems and methods of argumentation, as well as in the analysis of consistency/inconsistency.

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of TBI and the risk factors associated with presenting TBI in this group, considering sex, age, and migratory status as axes of inequality. A population-based, analytical, cross-sectional observational study was carried out in the city of Barcelona in the period 2003-2022. The study population was household contacts under 15 years of age with index cases of pulmonary TB reported to the Barcelona Public Health Agency in the period 2003-2022. The analyses were performed using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) to predict the risk of TBI among these cohabiting contacts and were stratified considering the inequality axes of sex and migratory status. A total of 1084 contacts under 15 years of age were studied from 693 cases of tuberculosis. TBI prevalence among contacts was 24.5%. The factors associated with the presence of TBI in the contacts were having a smear positive in the index case, being older than 5 years in the contacts ([5,10], [10-15]) and the case and the contact being migrants; smear positive when the index case was native women and being from a municipal district with a lower incidence of tuberculosis when the index case was native women and the men. The results of the study confirm the importance of carrying out contact tracing and follow-up of household children, especially if the index case is smear positive. Contact tracing should be carried out as soon as possible to assess the prescription of primary chemoprophylaxis and TBI treatment to avoid rapid TB progression in children.",,pubmed

This study aimed to identify the factors related to the co-occurrence of malaria and Chagas disease in the Brazilian Amazon from 2015 to 2019. The analysis explored 19 environmental indicators and two socioeconomic indicators related to habitat loss, land use and cover, climate anomalies, and the multidimensional poverty index. Modeling was performed by Conditional Inference Trees, adjusting models with and without contextual variables, to map areas of probable co-occurrence of the diseases. The incidence of malaria is predominant in the western Amazon, while Chagas disease is more frequent in areas of Para and parts of Amazonas and Acre. Municipalities with high coverage of native vegetation showed higher incidences of malaria, but not necessarily of Chagas disease. Municipalities with native vegetation cover and pasture areas showed heterogeneous incidence of diseases, with some presenting a high incidence of both diseases. The predictive analysis showed an increase in the number of municipalities with a high expected incidence of malaria (moderate) and disease Chagas (high) from 1 to 7, when compared to observed data. The study showed areas with a risk of moderate and high incidence of both diseases, covering a larger region than that observed in the period. Alternatives of shared surveillance and the integration of programs for the identification of cases and treatment can be a measure to optimize resources and help eradicate these diseases in the region.",,pubmed
A032,Is it possible to encourage TB testing and detect missing TB cases via community-level promotion of a self-screening mobile application? Quasi-experimental evidence from South Africa.,10.1136/bmjhci-2024-101179,Rich K; Burger R; Goldberg D; Moultrie H; Rieger M,2025.0,BMJ health & care informatics,"OBJECTIVES: While mobile health (mHealth) interventions are widespread, few studies assess impacts at the population level in low-income and middle-income countries. South Africa's tuberculosis (TB) burden is high, and a substantial share of cases remain undiagnosed. We evaluate the impacts of community activations of TBCheck-a WhatsApp/USSD-based chatbot that allows individuals to evaluate themselves for TB risk. METHODS: We use a quasi-experimental approach comparing treated and control subdistricts nationally before and after community activations using dashboard data from the TBCheck platform and weekly or quarterly subdistrict TB test data from the National Health Laboratory Service. Dependent variables are the number of self-screening tests on the platform, total tests and number of positive tests per subdistrict. We employ dynamic difference-in-difference models accounting for subdistrict unobservables and time trends using weekly data, and synthetic control methods matching on preintervention trends in outcomes using quarterly data. RESULTS: Impact estimates suggest an increase in the number of self-screening tests on the platform (487.53, p-value<0.01) as well as TB tests (107.90, p-value=0.05) in treated relative to control subdistricts due to intervention activities in the week of the intervention. After 2 weeks, impacts on the number of self-screening tests are insignificant (-6.18, p=0.23), and after 1 week, impacts on TB tests are insignificant (36.44, p-value=0.32). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Activation activities associated with TBCheck led to short-lived and variable impacts on uptake and tests in target subdistricts. Alternative strategies are required for sustained uptake of such mHealth tools.",,pubmed

Household surveys like the Demographic and Health Surveys have been widely used as a proxy for mapping SDG-related household characteristics. However, there is no consensus on the workflow to be used, and different methods have been implemented with varying complexities. This study aims to compare multiple modelling frameworks to model indicators of human vulnerability to malaria (SDG Target 3.3) in Senegal. These indicators were categorised into socioeconomic (e.g., stunting prevalence, wealth index) and malaria prevention indicators (e.g., indoor residual spraying, insecticide-treated net ownership). We compared three categories of the commonly used methods: (1) spatial interpolation methods (i.e., inverse distance weighting, thin plate splines, kriging), (2) ensemble methods (i.e., random forest), and (3) Bayesian geostatistical models. Most indicators could be modelled with medium to high predictive accuracy, with R2 values ranging from 0.40 to 0.86. No method or method category emerged as the best, but performance varied widely. Overall, socioeconomic indicators were generally better predicted by covariate-based models (e.g., random forest and Bayesian models), while methods using spatial autocorrelation alone (e.g., thin plate splines) performed better for variables with heterogeneous spatial structure, such as ethnicity and malaria prevention indicators. Increasing the complexity of the models did not always improve predictive performance, e.g., thin plate splines sometimes outperformed random forest or Bayesian geostatistical models. Beyond performance, we compared the different methods using other criteria (e.g., the ability to constrain the prediction range or to quantify prediction uncertainty) and discussed their implications for selecting a modelling approach tailored to the needs of the end user.",,pubmed

Patient contacts face a higher risk for infection and illness, which can subsequently contribute to the persistence of the disease. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the risk factors associated with anti-phenolic glycolipid-I (anti-PGL-I) seropositivity and leprosy development among contacts of leprosy patients in a highly endemic region. METHODS: A cohort of 629 contacts from the Almenara microregion, Minas Gerais, Brazil, was followed from 1998 to 2018. Our research group assessed risk factors, including sociodemographic determinants, bacillus exposure, and genetic susceptibility. FINDINGS: Analysis revealed that living with a multibacillary (MB) leprosy patient [odds ratio (OR): 3.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-8.86] and with a patient with grade II disabilities (OR: 4.43, 95% CI: 1.08-18.1) significantly increased the likelihood of anti-PGL-I seropositivity among asymptomatic contacts. Risk factors for leprosy included living with a patient in a shared residence (OR: 2.84, 95% CI: 1.21-6.67) and blood relation to the patient (OR: 2.56, 95% CI: 1.18-5.54). Notably, 98% of contacts who developed leprosy had lived with more than one patient. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Clinical characteristics of index patients play a critical role in infection risk among contacts. Leprosy progression appears to depend on genetic susceptibility, type of contact, and extent of bacillus exposure.",,pubmed

This study assessed malaria and anaemia prevalence and associated risk factors among pregnant women initiating antenatal care in selected districts of 2 regions of Ghana. METHODS: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted using data obtained from 5196 pregnant women at their booking antenatal care (ANC) visit. Women of any age, gestational age, parity and at any ANC visit, who consented were enrolled consecutively into the study. Data on socio-demographic and obstetric characteristics, bed net ownership and use were obtained using structured questionnaires. Haemoglobin concentration and malaria, Schistosoma and helminth infections were determined using an automated haematology analyser and microscopy, respectively. Summary statistics to describe study variables and chi-square test and logistic regression set at p < 0.05 to determine risk factors for anaemia and malaria were conducted using Stata SE14. RESULTS: Overall malaria prevalence was 5.74% [95% CI: 5.1-6.4] and anaemia prevalence was 55.22% [ 95% CI: 53.85-56.58]. Living in Volta region (p < 0.001), being secondi- (p = 0.003) or multigravida (p < 0.001) and being of lower middle socio-economic status (p = 0.004) reduced the women's risk of malaria parasite infection. Being anaemic (p = 0.001) and reporting a symptom (p < 0.001) increased the odds of Plasmodium infection among the women. Residing in Volta region (p < 0.001), having malaria infection (p < 0.001), and booking ANC in the 2nd (p < 0.001) and 3rd trimesters (p < 0.001) increased the odds of anaemia among the women. Age 25-34 years (p < 0.001) and >/= 35 years (p = 0.008) and belonging to middle (p = 0.009), upper middle (p = 0.006) or upper-level (p < 0.001) quintile of wealth index reduced the odds of anaemia among the women at their booking ANC visit. CONCLUSIONS: More than half the women were anaemic signifying a severe public health problem. Malaria prevalence, though low, was a significant risk factor for anaemia. Existing malaria and anaemia control strategies through ANC need strengthening, especially among young, first-time pregnant women. This study further highlights socio-economic status as an important risk factor for anaemia in pregnancy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable.",,pubmed

Therefore, this study aims to analyze the trends and patterns of the HIV/AIDS burden at the global, regional, and national levels by sex, age and social development index (SDI). We also explored risk factors and predicted the GBD of HIV/AIDS until 2030. METHODS: Data on the etiology of HIV/AIDS from 1990 to 2021 were collected from the 2021 GBD database. Estimated annual percent changes (EAPCs) were calculated to assess temporal trends in the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardized disability-adjusted life-year rate (ASDR) and age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) of HIV/AIDS patients. Measures categorized by sex, region, age and SDI quintiles. In addition, an age‒period‒cohort model was established to forecast future trends of the HIV/AIDS burden to 2030. RESULTS: Globally, the incidence of HIV/AIDS reached 1.65 million (95% uncertainty interval 1.48 to 1.82) in 2021. From 1990 to 2021, the global ASIR of HIV/AIDS showed a downward trend, with an EAPC of 0.14% (0.12-0.16%). The ASIR, ASDR, and ASMR of HIV/AIDS were highest in the low-SDI region and lowest in the high-SDI region. Regionally, southern sub-Saharan Africa had the highest ASIR in 2021, whereas Oceania had the largest increase in the ASIR from 1990 to 2021. Burundi (EAPC 14.04%, 95% CI -13.63 to -14.44%), followed by Burkina Faso, exhibited the most significant decrease in the ASIR. Globally, the highest incidence rate was observed in the 25-29 years old group. Unsafe sex is the primary factor leading to the burden of HIV/AIDS. By 2030, the global ASIR, ASDR and ASMR of HIV/AIDS are expected to gradually decrease. CONCLUSION: HIV/AIDS disease burden varies by region, sex, and age. The global burden of HIV/AIDS is substantial in low-income regions, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our study offers valuable epidemiological evidence for future research on the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS.",,pubmed

Different studies have been conducted on the prevalence of HBV infection among Ethiopian regions and population segments. Therefore, this systematic review was commenced to summarize these findings, deliver representative pooled data on the prevalence of HBV infection among Ethiopian administrative regions and population segments, and identify possible factors associated with HBV infection. METHODS: Electronic databases such as PubMed, African Journals Online, and Google Scholar were searched for published articles from July 9, 2019, to February 30, 2024. The data were exported to STATA version 15.1 for meta-analyses. The heterogeneity between the results of the primary studies was accessed using Cochran's Q chi-square test and quantified with I(2) statistics. A random effect model was used to pool the prevalence of HBV infection. RESULTS: The overall pooled prevalence of HBV infection was 6.9% (95% CI: 6.1, 7.7). Among the subgroup analyses, the highest pooled prevalence of HBV infection was obtained from Harar city 9.6% (95% CI: 5.6, 13.5), followed by South Nations and Nationalities People Regions (SNNPR) 8.5% (95% CI: 7.4, 9.7). On the other hand, the pooled prevalence of HBV infection among waste handlers was high 12.6% (95% CI: 2.4, 27.6) followed by female commercial sex workers (FCSW) 10.9% (95% CI: 7.7, 15.2) and human immune deficiency virus (HIV) positive individuals 9.9% (95% CI: 7.2, 12.8). HBV infection was significantly linked to the following factors: those with multiple sexual partners, a family history of chronic liver disease, exposure to bodily fluids, HIV seropositivity, and sharp needle injury had Adjusted Odd Ratio (AOR):3.9 (95% CI: 2.62, 5.76), (AOR: 6.9 (95% CI:3.46, 10.53), (AOR:3.1 (95% CI: 2.01, 3.05), (AOR:7.7 (95% CI: 2.99, 19.93), (AOR:2.1 (95% CI: 1.58, 2.66) times a greater chance of infection, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The high pooled prevalence of HBV infection in Ethiopia indicates that the burden of HBV infection continues to be a public health concern. The Ethiopian Ministry of Health should develop a strategic plan for prevention and control of HBV infection transmission including awareness creation, scale-up screening programs, diagnosis, treatment, and care services to reduce the burden of HBV infection and eliminate it as a public health threat.",,pubmed

Since leprosy has been contained at the national level in these countries, current efforts to eliminate leprosy have focused on specific leprosy high-risk areas. Quantifying the factors associated with leprosy risk would assist in identifying high-risk areas and the required efforts for leprosy elimination, which are still inadequate in these countries. To further progress a leprosy-free world, we investigated the associations between socioeconomic factors and the risk of leprosy in Yunnan Province, China. METHODS: Socioeconomic factors and leprosy cases for 129 counties in Yunnan Province from 2004 to 2019 were collected. A spatiotemporal Bayesian model was used to evaluate the socioeconomic factors associated with leprosy risk. RESULTS: 4,361 leprosy cases were reported from 2004 to 2019 in Yunnan. Negative associations between disposable income per capita of rural residents (RR = 0.947, 95% CI: 0.907, 0.989), population density (RR = 0.920, 95% CI: 0.894, 0.945), the number of students enrolled by regular secondary schools (RR = 0.990, 95% CI: 0.986, 0.994), and leprosy risk were found in Yunnan Province. The associations between the per capita product of the primary industry, proportion of male population, number of beds in health and medical institutions per 1,000 population, and leprosy risk were not significant. CONCLUSION: This study revealed the associations between socioeconomic factors and leprosy risk in a low-burden country. These findings suggest that subsequent leprosy elimination efforts in Yunnan Province should prioritize rural areas, particularly those with lower population density and lower economic levels among farmers. Additionally, it is crucial to actively target poor rural farmers as a high-risk group for leprosy through strengthened early detection, multidrug therapy, and health education.",,pubmed

CONCLUSION: Black people, especially Black men with lower education levels, tuberculosis and street dwellers, have higher HIV prevalence, requiring greater attention from prevention strategies and testing for sexually transmitted infections.",,pubmed
A040,Factors associated with HIV infection among women of different marital statuses in Cameroon: A cross-sectional study (2017-2018).,10.1097/MD.0000000000042001,Mapouka M; Kwawa I; M'Bangot MA; Adouaka GR; Adamou AOM; Ndanga Yanoe SCR; Koffo-Baguette TA; Ndemazie NB; Mbesse TU; Mmereole S; Nwogu N,2025.0,Medicine,"The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among women aged 15 to 49 years has declined over the last decade in Cameroon but remains relatively high. We explored factors influencing HIV prevalence among women in different types of unions and marital statuses and compared them to those who were married. The analysis included data from 2017 to 2018 Cameroon Population-based HIV Impact Assessment, a cross-sectional household-based study covering 10 regions in Cameroon. Consenting participants provided demographic characteristics and HIV-related risk behavior data through interviews, along with a blood sample for HIV testing conducted in the household using the national rapid HIV test. In our weighted multivariate analysis, we examined the relationships between HIV infection and various demographic and behavioral variables among women aged 15 to 49. The analysis included factors such as residence, region, education level, marital status, type of union, wealth quintile, and pregnancy status. HIV prevalence ranged from 2.0% to 18.8% across different marital statuses. After adjusting for age, residence, wealth quintile, education level, marital status, and union type, divorced women were 9.3 times as likely to be HIV-positive compared with married women (95% confidence interval: 2.4, 35.6), with the difference being statistically significant. While HIV prevalence among women aged 15 to 49 in Cameroon has declined, divorced and separated women have substantially higher odds of HIV infection compared with married women. Marital status is a key factor, with varying HIV prevalence among women in different marital situations. Therefore, targeted interventions should consider marital status in the national plan to address HIV prevention and care.",,pubmed

The transformation of HIV into a chronic condition, coupled with regional disparities and evolving epidemiological trends, necessitates an updated analysis of the disease burden. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of HIV/AIDS burden among individuals aged 15-79 years from 1990 to 2021 using the latest data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 database. Multiple statistical approaches were employed to investigate temporal trends, geographic variations, and health inequalities. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2021, global HIV/AIDS age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) decreased by 41%, while age-standardized prevalence rates (ASPR), mortality rates (ASMR), and disability-adjusted life year rates increased by 222%, 57%, and 59%, respectively. Sub-Saharan Africa demonstrated the highest HIV/AIDS ASPR in 2021, with High-middle and Middle SDI regions, particularly Oceania, South Asia, and Eastern Europe, experiencing the most significant ASPR growth over three decades. Joinpoint analysis identified 1997 and 2015 as critical years for ASIR declines, and 2004 for ASMR reductions. Decomposition analysis revealed population growth as the primary driver of increasing incidence in lower SDI regions, while epidemiological changes were more influential in higher SDI areas. The age-period-cohort model showed peak HIV/AIDS incidence among individuals aged 25-34, with diminishing incidence risk across successive birth cohorts and periods. Health inequality analysis from 1990 to 2021 revealed a substantial widening of disparities across countries, with the slope index of inequality rising from 265 to 1006. CONCLUSION: While global efforts have reduced HIV/AIDS incidence, increasing prevalence due to extended survival with antiretroviral therapy presents ongoing challenges. Regional disparities and rising incidence among specific demographics underscore the need for sustained, targeted interventions.",,pubmed

However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of visceral leishmaniasis in the local community and the potential driving factors remain poorly understood. METHODS: We analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of new reported visceral leishmaniasis cases in the region from 2006 to 2023, and combined random forest modeling approach with environmental covariates to identify the main influencing factors related to transmission risk of the disease. RESULTS: Our results show that there was a total number of 800 reported human visceral leishmaniasis cases, affecting 29 cities, and 113 counties across the region, exhibiting a geographic expansion of the disease during this period, especially in Shanxi province. Two high-risk clusters were identified in the study. Environmental change-related factors, including standardized precipitation deviation, forest cumulative change ratio, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) cumulative change, played important roles in increasing the transmission risk of visceral leishmaniasis, with their relative contributions summing up to 66.17%. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a better understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics and driving factors of visceral leishmaniasis recurrence across Central China around the Taihang Mountains, which underscore prevention and control measures should be taken immediately to reduce the risk.",,pubmed

METHODS: An ecological study based on real-world DRTB data from 2010 to 2022, in the Rio de Janeiro state, using data from the Special Tuberculosis Treatment Information System (SITE-TB) and demographic census. Crude incidence rates (CIR) of DRTB per 100,000 inhabitants and smoothed rates through the Global and Local Empirical Bayesian (BEG and BEL) methods were calculated. Spatial autocorrelation was explored using Moran's I statistic, Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA), and the Getis-Ord statistics. The SCAN method was also used to identify spatial-time clusters. To analyze the association of DRTB and determinants, we used LISA bivariate for spatial correlation and four explanatory statistical models were listed. RESULTS: From 2010 to 2022, 2,709 new cases of DRTB were reported (CIR 16.9/100,000 inhabitants). The municipalities in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro state had the highest rates. Despite 41% of municipalities reporting no new cases, BEG and BEL suggested higher rates than CIR, indicating underreporting. Spatial heterogeneity was observed, and spatial and spatial-temporal clusters and hotspots were detected in metropolitan region. Family health strategy coverage was identified as protection factor, however a not expected negative spatial autocorrelation between CIR and health strategy coverage, primary care and healthcare agent coverage was found. The variables identified as risk factors were population aged >/=18 years old with Elementary School completed (OR:1.10; CI95%:1.04-1.16), demographic density (OR: 1.00; CI95%:1.00-1.01), HIV-TB coinfection (OR: 1.18; CI95%:1.06-1.31). CONCLUSION: The identification of areas of risk for DRTB, spatial correlation and association between incidence and determinants, demonstrates that the DRTB transmission dynamics is related to the perpetuation of social inequality and urban spatial organization.",,pubmed

Xerostomia, or dry mouth, is a common complaint among people living with HIV (PLHIV) which increases their risk of acquiring oral diseases. This study aimed to assess the magnitude of xerostomia and the associated factors in this group of patients. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional hospital-based study was conducted among 420 PLHIV on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) aged 18 years and above. Informed consent was obtained from the participants during data collection. The xerostomia was assessed using a questionnaire. Pearson's chi(2) test was used to correlate independent (sociodemographic factors, oral health-related, and HIV-related factors) and dependent variables (xerostomia). Univariate and adjusted multinomial logistic regression were used to determine the odds ratio (OR) of xerostomia. RESULTS: Xerostomia was observed in 36.3% of the respondents. The chi-square test showed a significantly higher proportion of xerostomia among the unemployed (p = 0.014), those who were HIV diagnosed up to five years (p = 0.014), and those having CD4(+) counts >/= 500 cells/ mm(3) (p = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, higher odds of having xerostomia were found among participants with higher viral load (OR = 2.6; CI = 1.07-6.3), whereas lower odds were found among self-employed participants (OR = 0.48; CI = 0.28-0.82) and employed participants (OR = 0.52; CI = 0.27-0.98). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of xerostomia is moderately high among PLHIV. Higher viral load and unemployment were the associated factors with xerostomia. Low CD4(+) counts, duration of HAART use, and HAART regime were not associated with xerostomia.",,pubmed

When developing specific schistosomiasis control intervention program, the existing knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) must be taken into account. This study aimed to assess the KAPs of primary schoolchildren towards urinary schistosomiasis in Ethiopia. METHODS: A total of 1171 study participants aged 5 to 15 years were selected randomly. RESULTS: Of the 1171 interviewed schoolchildren, 654, or 55.8%, said they had heard of urinary schistosomiasis. Using river or dam water for household consumption had association with urinary schistosomiasis infection history (P = 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that males had higher risk of getting urinary schistosomiasis infection compared to females (OR = 3.01, P < 0.001). Children in low socio-economic status had higher risk of having urinary schistosomiasis compared to high socio-economic status (OR = 2.81, P < 0.001). Compared to urban dweller, children in rural area had higher risk of having urinary schistosomiasis (OR = 4.34, P < 0.001). Respondents who used river water (OR = 2.48, P = 0.005) and lake or dam water (OR = 3.33, P = < 0.001) were at higher risk of urinary schistosomiasis infection. Furthermore, respondents swimming or playing in river water had higher risk of urinary schistosomiasis infection history (OR = 1.62, P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: There was knowledge gap in schoolchildren about urinary schistosomiasis causes, transmission, symptoms and prevention. Therefore, appropriate health education and behavioral change intervention is needed to create better knowledge and practices in children to prevent and control urinary schistosomiasis. Health organizations and policy makers should contribute to improve knowledge at the school as well as community level.",,pubmed

Currently, there are no pooled estimates of opportunistic infections incidence among children on ART in Ethiopia. Consequently, this review aimed to determine the pooled incidence and identify the predictors of opportunistic infections among children under 15 years of age on ART, addressing the existing information gap. METHODS: This systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines, and relevant studies were obtained from the PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases. Data analysis for pooled estimates of incidence and predictors of opportunistic infections was conducted via STATA 17 software with random-effects model. Heterogeneity was evaluated via Cochrane's Q-test and the I(2) statistic, and publication bias was assessed through funnel plots and Egger's test. RESULTS: Of the 5,631 studies identified, 20 studies involving 9,196 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled incidence of opportunistic infections among children under 15 years of age on antiretroviral therapy was 5.61 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 4.37-6.86), based on 36,716.4 person-years of observation. Predictors of opportunistic infections included advanced WHO clinical stage (HR 1.45, 95% CI: 1.35-1.55), poor ART adherence (HR 1.49, 95% CI: 1.35-1.63), lack of isoniazid (HR 1.56, 95% CI: 1.40-1.74) and cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (HR 1.56, 95% CI: 1.38-1.66), malnutrition (HR 1.50, 95% CI: 1.34-1.67), and severe immunosuppression (HR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.27-1.51). CONCLUSION: The incidence of opportunistic infections in this review was high, highlighting the need for intensified efforts to achieve the 2030 target. Moreover, advanced WHO clinical stage, poor adherence, lack of isoniazid and cotrimoxazole preventive therapy, malnutrition, and severe immunosuppression were identified as predictors of opportunistic infections. This suggests that early initiation of ART, regular nutritional assessments, intensive follow-up and monitoring, and a multidisciplinary approach need be prioritized to address the identified predictors.",,pubmed

A cross-sectional observational study evaluated 238 PLWHIV attending a specialized dental outpatient clinic in Brazil. We collected sociodemographic data, self-reported and physician-diagnosed comorbidities, hemogram results, CD4+ T cell count, viral load, use of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), and information on harmful habits. The most prevalent comorbidities were sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (116/238; 48.7%), psychiatric disorders (105/238; 44.1%), and lipodystrophy (97/238; 40.8%). Men were more likely to have STIs (OR 4.0) and tuberculosis (OR: 2.5) (p < 0.05). Age >/= 50 years increased the risk of diabetes mellitus by 2.6 times (p < 0.05). The risk of lipodystrophy (OR: 2.99, 95%CI 1.44-6.19) and psychiatric disorders (OR: 2.13, 95%CI 1.01-4.47) was greater in those who had been diagnosed with HIV for more than 20 years.

However, it remains uncertain whether the multi-tiered medical insurance system disproportionately influences the health impacts of climate risks. METHODS: Using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) from 2011 to 2020, matched with urban climate risk variables, we employ a multi-dimensional panel fixed effects model and an instrumental variable model to examine the impact of climate risks on the health of the middle-aged and elderly, while also investigating the unequal effects of the multi-tiered medical insurance system. RESULTS: Climate risks significantly worsened the self-reported health of the middle-aged and elderly (beta = 0.073, P = 0.089), and increased both total medical costs (beta = 2.570, P = 0.012) and out-of-pocket expenses (beta = 2.652, P = 0.003). Notably, the increases in hospitalization costs (beta = 0.721, P = 0.004) and out-of-pocket hospitalization expenses (beta = 0.706, P = 0.036) are particularly prominent. The current multi-tiered medical insurance system results in unequal impacts of climate risks on health and medical costs. Specifically, urban employee medical insurance and commercial medical insurance effectively improve the health outcomes of elderly individuals affected by climate risks. Urban residents' medical insurance significantly reduces both total medical costs and out-of-pocket expenses for the elderly, whereas the new rural cooperative medical insurance shows no significant mitigating effect. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that the integration of urban and rural resident medical insurance can reduce the medical burden on rural elderly populations caused by climate risks. Our long-term projections indicate that, under both the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, the increase in elderly healthcare costs due to climate risks is irreversible. However, restrictive climate policies would yield significant health benefits, potentially reducing per capita medical costs for the elderly by nearly 50%. CONCLUSIONS: The decentralized multi-tier medical insurance system leads to significant inequality in the health impacts of climate risks. Our study emphasizes the critical role of reforming the existing social medical insurance system and implementing climate policies to protect the health of elderly populations.",,pubmed

Despite interventions such as insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying, malaria prevalence remains high. While housing structure and sanitation are recognized as risk factors in other African countries, their relationship with malaria infection among under-five children in Nigeria remains underexplored. This study investigates this association using nationally representative data from the 2021 Nigeria Malaria Indicator Survey (NMIS). METHODS: This study analysed data from the 2021 NMIS, including 1833 children aged 5-59 months (weighted sample size: 1,784,805,486) tested for malaria using rapid tests. Data on malaria prevention practices, household characteristics, and children's blood samples were collected. The primary outcome was malaria test results (rapid diagnostic test, RDT), with the type of toilet facility as the main predictor. Covariates included age, sex, wealth index, maternal education, residence type, household construction materials, drinking water sources, type of mosquito nets, and mosquito net usage. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess associations, reporting adjusted odds ratios (aORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p-values < 0.05. RESULTS: Children from the poorest (aOR = 3.412, 95% CI: 1.798-6.477, p = 0.0002) and poorer households (aOR = 3.103, 95% CI: 1.714-5.617, p = 0.0002) had significantly higher malaria risk. Rural residence (aOR = 1.898, 95% CI: 1.318-2.734, p = 0.0006) and no maternal education (aOR = 2.003, 95% CI: 1.153-3.480, p = 0.0139) were also associated with increased malaria prevalence. Additionally, unimproved wall materials (aOR = 1.604, 95% CI: 1.061-2.425, p = 0.025) increased malaria risk. However, unimproved sanitation facilities were not significantly associated with malaria risk (p = 0.166). CONCLUSION: Malaria risk among under-five children in Nigeria is strongly associated with socioeconomic factors, rural residence, and maternal education, but not unimproved sanitation alone. Efforts to reduce malaria prevalence should target broader social determinants through health education and socioeconomic interventions in Nigeria and other endemic regions.",,pubmed

In this study, we aim to determine the prevalence of silico-tuberculosis among TB patients and to investigate the association of radiographic silicosis and the role of drug supervisor as well as other socio-clinical factors, in the development of MDR-TB in Indonesia. METHODS: A hospital-based study in West Java among 148 MDR-TB patients (case) and 164 drug-sensitive/DS-TB patients (control) was conducted. Chest x-rays were evaluated by two radiologists and one NIOSH B reader according to the ILO Classification. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using structured questionnaires to collect patients' information, including the task of drug supervisor. RESULTS: Findings indicate that supportive drug supervisor reduces the risk of developing MDR-TB, but silicosis showed no significant association. Nevertheless, in this study we found that 17 cases (5.4%) had silico-tuberculosis mostly exhibited as ILO profusion 3; predominated by q shape, 52.9% with large opacities and dominated by size A. Other factors significantly associated with the risk of developing MDR-TB were marital status, low income, longer traveling time to hospital, unsuccessful previous treatment and suffering drug side effects. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that one of preventive healthcare strategy to protect TB patients from developing MDR-TB is supportive drug supervisor. While, the development of MDR-TB was not significantly influenced by silicosis; however, there is a notable prevalence of silicosis as determined by chest radiography, highlighting the critical need for dust control, occupational hygiene, and health screening for high-risk populations.",,pubmed

This empirical study assesses smallholder farmers' adaptation options to climate change or variability for achieving food security. METHODS: Data were gathered from a survey of 328 respondents, selected randomly and proportionally from three different agro-ecological zones. Additional qualitative insights were collected through focus group discussions and interviews with key informants to reinforce the findings. The multinomial endogenous switching regression, independent t-test and the instrumental variable (2sls) regression were used as method of analysis. RESULTS: The result indicated that ACAC impacted food security positively and significantly in the study area at a percent rate of 12.4, 16.3,18 and 27.7 when households adopting one, two, three, and four ACAC, respectively, in the HFBM case, and the same meaning was obtained from other food security measuring tools. However, the rate and manner of change differ at different agroecologies, signifying careful discernment when applying ACAC at different spacial areas, especially in agroecology. The change in agroecology declares that midlands have a negative likelihood propensity for climate adaptation compared to highlands, while lowlands have positive and insignificant implications. The mean comparison from the independent t-test showed statistically significant adopters and non-adopters food security measures, which also informed the positive contribution of CACA on households' food security. Interestingly, factors such as distance to water sources, land size, ox ownership, crop income, and access to credit influenced food security in diverse ways depending on regional and contextual specifics. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, ACAC impacts food security differently at different rates in different agroecologies in the area. Integrated and tailored technical, institutional, and policy interventions are needed to tackle the calamities of climate change leap to smallholder farming and food security.",,pubmed

Using 2015-2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data (N = 212,411), we estimated prevalence rates and conducted multinomial logistic regression to assess associations between HIV status and (1) substance use and (2) sociodemographic factors. Results show PWH have higher rates of consistent and former use of a range of substances, including inhalants, methamphetamine, cocaine, and heroin. Younger PWH are more likely to use cannabis and hallucinogens, while middle-aged PWH show elevated methamphetamine use. Male and urban-residing PWH face higher risks for inhalants and cocaine. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions addressing substance use disparities among PWH, particularly for high-risk subgroups and substances. Integrated care models emphasizing harm reduction and relapse prevention are critical. Policy reforms should expand Medicaid and Ryan White Program coverage to include comprehensive substance use treatment for PWH. Future research should explore longitudinal patterns of substance use transitions and the impact of structural factors such as stigma on these disparities to inform effective prevention and treatment strategies.",,pubmed
A054,Spatial distribution of malaria among under-five children and associated factors in Tanzania: a spatial and multilevel analysis.,10.1186/s12936-025-05313-w,Animut Y; Nigatu SG; Teklu RE; Abiy SA,2025.0,Malaria journal,"BACKGROUND: Malaria is a major public health problem in Tanzania, accounting for 3.1% of the global cases, with under-five children being particularly vulnerable. Over half of malaria deaths in Tanzania occurred among under-five children. Identifying the spatial determinants of malaria is crucial for optimizing targeted interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the spatial determinants of malaria and factors associated with malaria infection among under-five children in Tanzania. METHODS: A secondary data analysis was carried out using the Tanzanian Demographic and Health Survey and Malaria Indicator Survey (TDHS-MIS) 2022 data. A total weighted sample of 4971 under-five children was included in the analysis. Spatial determinants of malaria were identified by ordinary least square and geographically weighted regression analysis. A multilevel binary logistic regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with malaria infection among under-five children. RESULTS: Malaria among under-five children was spatially clustered in Tanzania (Moran's Index = 0.14, p-value < 0.0001). Significant primary clusters of malaria were identified in the Northwestern part of the country (western and Lake zones) (log-likelihood ratio (LLR = 80.22, p < 0.0001) and secondary clusters in the Mtwara region (LLR = 16.04, p < 0.0001). Wealth index and access to health care were significant determinants of spatial clustering of malaria among under-five children. In the multilevel analysis, maternal education [primary level (AOR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.97)], child age of 48-59 months (AOR = 3.17, 95% CI: 1.80-5.62), family size of 5 to 10 (AOR = 1.69, 95%CI 1.12, 2.54), being in poor wealth index (AOR = 2.56, 95% CI 1.18-5.57), and unimproved roof (AOR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.04-2.16) were significantly associated with malaria infection among under-five children. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: Malaria among under-five children in Tanzania shows significant spatial clustering, particularly in the Northwestern and Southern parts of the country. This spatial clustering of malaria was attributed to poor socioeconomic status and lack of access to health care. Improving access to health care and enhancing malaria prevention measures for the economically disadvantaged group could have a better impact on reducing the burden of malaria.",,pubmed
A055,A longitudinal macro analysis of social determinants of health and their impacts on HIV prevalence and nutritional deficiencies in Sub-Saharan Africa.,S0001-6918(25)00182-9,Payi MA; Abaver D; Apalata T,2025.0,Acta psychologica,"Sub-Saharan Africa faces a dual public health crisis of HIV and nutritional deficiencies driven by profound socio-economic disparities. Despite significant micro-study research, macro-level, longitudinal patterns and causal dynamics remain underexplored. This study employs Panel Auto-regressive distributed lags, Panel Granger causality, and Vector auto-correction model to examine the influence of social determinants on HIV prevalence and nutritional deficiencies across Sub-Saharan Africa. The study further carried out robustness diagnostics using Driscoll - Kraay standard error regression to confirm the reliability of the results. For HIV prevalence, income, education, and employment reduce rates over the long term, while healthcare access and housing quality show positive associations. Short-term effects show the benefits of income and healthcare access, with other factors showing limited impact. For nutritional deficiencies, income, education, employment, and housing quality significantly reduce malnutrition in the long term, while healthcare access correlates positively. Short-term effects show the immediate role of income and housing quality. The causal results show unidirectional links between income, education, employment, and housing quality to HIV. Housing quality and income exhibit bidirectional causality. No causal link exists between HIV and nutritional deficiencies. The study recommends the need for income support programs, expanded educational access, skill development, and strengthened healthcare systems.",,pubmed
A056,Risk factors associated with malaria infection in children aged from 6 to 59 months in Niger: a cross-sectional study.,10.1186/s12889-025-22211-7,Nadakou NT; Paraiso MN; Yobo JB; Makoutode CP; Sodjinou J; Tapha O; Adehossi EO,2025.0,BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: Malaria is a pathology that contributes significantly to the increase in infant and child mortality and is ranked as the second leading cause of mortality after HIV/AIDS in Africa. WHO has recommended seasonal malaria chemoprevention to fight this pathology effectively. However, it is clear that the under-5 age group remains and continues to have one of the highest mortality rates due to malaria. With this in mind, we conducted this study on the prevalence and risk factors associated with malaria infection in children aged 6-59 months in Niger, and consequently to help inform national malaria control programs on how best to use their resources to achieve their objectives. METHODS: To achieve the objective of this study, we first used the database of the Niger Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS). It was carried out in 2021 by the National Institute of Statistics (NIS) in collaboration with the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) of the Ministry of Public Health, Population and Social Affairs (MSP/P/AS). Secondly, we used the databases of Notifiable Diseases (DND) of the Directorate of Surveillance and Response to Epidemics (DSRE) of Niger from 2019 to 2022. RESULTS: Of the children who received a Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT), 23.70% were positive for malaria in 2021 in Niger. The standard of living of households, the highest level of education of the mother, the place of residence, and the child's sex all influence the probability of children having malaria. Children from low-income households and those from middle-income households are respectively 50% and 63.7% more likely to have malaria compared to those from high-income households. Children whose mothers have no level of education and those whose mothers have a primary level of education have a risk respectively 2.5 times and 2.3 times greater of having malaria than those whose mothers have the highest level. Children in urban areas are 69.1% less likely to suffer from malaria infection than those in rural areas. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that improving the standard of living and education of mothers could reduce malaria infection rates among children. Malaria is much more prevalent in rural areas.",,pubmed

The objective of the study was to analyze the magnitude and relevance of tuberculosis-diabetes and diabetes-COVID-19 comorbidities in spatial risk areas and their factors associated with unfavorable outcomes in the Brazilian population between 2020 and 2022. An ecological study was carried out in Brazilian municipalities. The population was composed by cases of tuberculosis-diabetes and diabetes-COVID-19 comorbidities, registered in the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System (SIVEP-GRIPE) and in DATASUS from 2020 to 2022. The Scan Statistics technique was used to identify spatial risk clusters. Binary logistic regression was then employed to understand the relationship between outcomes and comorbidities, considering clinical and sociodemographic variables. A total of 24,750 cases of tuberculosis-diabetes comorbidity were identified, which consisted of an incidence of 3.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Risk clusters were identified in the Central-West and North regions. 303,210 cases of diabetes- COVID-19 comorbidity were identified, resulting in an incidence of 0.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Sao Paulo-SP, Rio de Janeiro-RJ and Belo Horizonte-MG were the municipalities with the highest spatial risk of illness. The analysis of the spatial risk areas revealed distinct patterns in the geographic distribution of comorbidities. Based on the findings, it is concluded that comorbidities between tuberculosis and diabetes, as well as between COVID-19 and diabetes, represent significant challenges for public health in Brazil, deserving attention from health authorities and the scientific community.",,pubmed

This study analyzed the temporal trend in the rate of new leprosy cases with grade 2 physical disability in Brazil and identified spatial clusters of risk for physical disability. METHODS: This is an ecological study of all new cases of leprosy with grade 2 physical disability (G2D) at diagnosis between 2001 and 2022 in Brazil, macro-regions, states and municipalities. Data were extracted from the National System of Notifiable Diseases and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Sociodemographic and clinical variables such as age, sex, race/colour, education and clinical form of the disease were analyzed, as well as the rate of new cases of leprosy with grade 2 physical disability at the time of diagnosis per million inhabitants. Data analysis was divided into three stages: 1- Descriptive analysis of the socio-demographic and clinical profile; 2- Time series analysis: In this stage, the joint-point regression model was used; 3- Spatial analysis, using global and local Moran statistics. RESULTS: There were 50,466 new cases of leprosy with G2D during the period studied, 97.4% aged > 14 years, 70.2% male, 45.7% brown, 87.6% with low education, 90.2% multibacillary and 47.5% dimorphic clinical form. There was a downward trend in the detection of leprosy with physical disability grade 2, with an average annual reduction of 2.8% (13.6/1 million in 2001 and 9.1/1 million in 2022). The southeast, south and north regions showed a downward trend. A total of 14 states and 4 capitals showed a decrease in the rate, the most significant being Roraima (-11.0%/year). Tocantins was the only state with an upward trend (3.2%/year). 635 (14.1%) municipalities were in the high-high quadrant. These municipalities belong to 12 Brazilian states and accounted for 30% (n = 15,139) of all cases recorded in the country over the 22 years analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an overall decrease in the detection of leprosy with physical disability in Brazil and highlight geographical disparities in the occurrence of leprosy disability. Interventions to promote early diagnosis should be targeted at areas with the highest rate of new cases with grade 2 disability.",,pubmed

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of dementia among PLHIV and people without HIV (POHIV) in Malawi. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective medical record review of 400 consecutive patients from a single tertiary health center (200 PLHIV from an HIV clinic and 200 POHIV from an outpatient clinic) in Lilongwe, Malawi. RESULTS: The overall rate of dementia was higher in PLHIV than that in POHIV (22% vs 10%; p = 1.4e). Older age, unknown employment or unemployed, and depression were significant risk factors for dementia for PLHIV, while older age and depression were significant among POHIV. DISCUSSION: Our study confirmed the increased risk of dementia in PLHIV and provides valuable groundwork for future dementia studies to accurately examine the prevalence and risk factors of dementia in SSA, including Malawi. HIGHLIGHTS: Malawians, in SSA, face the double burden of HIV AD and related dementias. We conducted a retrospective medical record review to assess dementia prevalence and risk factors. Dementia prevalence was higher in PLHIV than in POHIV. Older age, unknown employment or unemployed, and depression were risk factors for dementia in PLHIV. Our findings, reflecting the current diagnosing and medical documenting practice in Malawi, provide valuable groundwork for future dementia research in Malawi.",,pubmed

However, studies on the impacts of climate-driven rising sea levels on mental health remain few. This study aims to examine the risk of depression among people who live in coastal areas susceptible to the natural hazards associated with climate change. We used the Indonesia Basic Health Survey 2018, which included 642,419 adults in Indonesia. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between living in a coastal hazard area and depression. We included socio-demographics, health status, and health access information in the analysis to identify the most vulnerable groups. Our findings show that people who live in coastline hazard areas have 1.13 times higher odds to have depression than people who live outside those areas. Individuals living in the coastal hazards areas who were less likely to have autonomous mobility or resources, including young adults, females, those with low socio-economic conditions, and those with pre-existing health conditions, had a higher risk of depression than other groups. Culturally acceptable and effective mental health interventions should thus target these vulnerable populations and settings to effectively reduce climate-related health risks.",,pubmed

More than half (54%) of all participants reported having two or more unmet needs. Hispanic individuals were more likely to be at risk in 2 or more domains than their non-Hispanic counterparts. Food insecurity was the most common risk factor reported and when present, 51% of patients also reported financial resource strain. Surprisingly, when language preference was analyzed, English-preferring Hispanic patients were at higher risk of financial resource strain, daily stress, and food insecurity compared to those who preferred Spanish. When accounting for birthplace, Hispanic patients born in the US reported higher rates of daily stress, food insecurity, and unavailable transportation compared to Hispanic patients born in Puerto Rico or elsewhere outside the US. Increased SDOH risk factors including financial resource strain, housing and utilities strain, and limited transportation access were significantly associated with higher rates of no-shows to HIV clinic appointments but not with increased viral load or consistent completed clinic visits. In a mixed-effects model, each additional at-risk domain correlated to a 0.198 increase in the no show rate. This model also demonstrates higher rates of no-show visits in English-preferring Hispanic patients compared to Spanish-preferring patients. Overall, SDOH risk factors were commonly reported in our population and their presence were associated with higher no-show rates but not with viral suppression.",,pubmed

DESIGN: We used purposive sampling to recruit a representative cohort of PWH aged at least 19 years from January 2016 to September 2018. Participants completed a survey and consented to link their data with the BC Vital Statistics Agency, where deaths were recorded. METHODS: We conducted bivariate analyses to compare characteristics between participants who died with those alive as of September 2021. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to examine factors associated with mortality. RESULTS: As of September 2021, 71 (11%) of 644 participants died. The most common specified cause of death was due to overdose ( n  = 14, 19.7%). A higher proportion of individuals who died had been incarcerated (52.1 vs. 33.3%; P  = 0.002), reported recent homelessness (28.2 vs. 12.6%; P  < 0.001) and recent injection drug use (32.4 vs. 19%; P  = 0.009), compared to those alive at the end of follow-up. Age at least 60 [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 3.80, 95% confidence interval (95% CI 1.55-9.34], and experiencing homelessness in the last 12 months prior to enrolment (aHR 2.01, 95% CI 1.18-3.61) were associated with an increased hazard of death, while identifying as gay or lesbian (aHR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23-0.77), and having greater social support (aHR 0.88 per 10-unit score increase, 95% CI 0.81-0.96) were protective.

About 10245 children were selected for the current study and based on the rapid diagnostic test (RDT) results, there is about 37% prevalence of malaria in children under 5 years old in Nigeria. Malaria is the leading public health concern, that contributes to child mortality in the African region. METHODS: The Nigeria Malaria Indicator Survey (NMIS) 2021 was utilized in this investigation. For the 2021 NMIS, a two-stage sampling technique was used. According to the NIMS study, the children chosen for anaemia and RDT testing were under 5 years of age. RESULTS: A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) was used to examine malaria RDT findings in conjunction with demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic characteristics. The following underlying risk factors for malaria in children were discovered in the study: altitude, anaemia level, age in months, fever status in the past 2 weeks, toilet facility, main wall material, main roof material, household wealth index, type of place of residence, sex of the child, mother's education level, and knowledge of the preventative measures that can be used to prevent malaria. CONCLUSION: Missing data were not deleted in this investigation; instead, multiple imputations utilizing chained equations were used to approximate the missing observation. Based on the results found by using the GLMM, the findings of this study may influence how the government combats malaria in Nigeria. The novelty of this study is that the missing values were not dropped. However, imputation techniques were explored, and multiple imputation by chained equations was used.",,pubmed

In many TB high-burden countries, only about 25% of household contacts (HHCs) completing household TB evaluation and 20-89% of eligible contacts did not adhere to TB screening. The study was conducted to assess the yield of door-to-door TB household contact investigation among household contact of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB cases in central Ethiopia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out in selected health facilities of central Ethiopia from January 1, 2023 to December 3, 2023.All sequential voluntary bacteriologically confirmed TB patients and their HHCs without discrimination by age were included in the study. Xpert Ultra assay and TB culture were used to investigate active TB from sputum sample. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to determine the correlation between the index case cycle threshold value and the corresponding HHCs. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to investigate the associated risk factors for active TB in HHCs. RESULTS: Among 967 HHCs claimed by 303 index cases (259 drug susceptible TB (DS-TB) and 44 multi-drug resistance TB (MDR/RR-TB)), 902(93.07%) HHCs had received baseline symptom-based TB evaluation. Presumptive TB was identified in 20.17% (182) of the evaluated HHCs and 13(1.44%) were diagnosed with active TB. Eleven HHCs (7.24%; 95% CI: 3.85-12.9%) from DS-TB index case contacts and 2 (6.67%; 95% CI: 1.16-23.51) from MDR/RR-TB indexes HHCs were found to be MTB detected Rifampicin resistance not detected cases. The Xpert ultra assay results revealed an 84.62% (95% CI: 57.77-95.68) Rifampicin drug resistance concordance between the index case and the corresponding HHC. Active TB was significantly associated with night sweating and sharing a bed with the index patient, P-value < 0.05. CONCLUSION: Home-to-home TB contact screening have high active TB yield and implementable in both rural and urban areas of the nation only by mentoring and motivating the health extension workers. Proximity to bacteriologically confirmed TB patient for long time exposes household contacts for active TB. Scheduling convenient times and last-mile service delivery to contacts is very important to address the missed active TB cases in the community.",,pubmed

HIV,"BACKGROUND: An individual's HIV risk, and consequently their HIV prevention needs, change over time. In this study we aimed to quantify these changes, examine which life-course events were associated with them, and investigate the extent to which those life-course events were associated with HIV acquisition. METHODS: We used longitudinal data from eight rounds of a general population cohort in Manicaland province, eastern Zimbabwe, on sociodemographic and HIV risk behaviours, as well as HIV serostatus from the first seven rounds. We first visualised how HIV risk behaviours, comprised of having multiple, concurrent, non-regular, or transactional partners, condom non-use, drug use, and visiting bars, changed for individuals over time using Sankey diagrams. We then examined whether logistic regression models incorporating life-course events-namely, changes in marital or employment status, in-migration, or birth of a child-were more strongly associated with changes in HIV risk behaviour than models using only sociodemographic variables. Finally, we compared how well sociodemographic, HIV risk behaviour, and life-course events were associated with the person's risk of HIV acquisition as follows: we used logistic regression to identify which states (divided into sociodemographic, HIV risk behaviour, and life-course events) were most strongly associated with risk of HIV acquisition; based on this we use three models (corresponding to the three divisions) to identify the top 20% of individuals predicted to be at risk of acquiring HIV by each model, and computed what proportion of the actual HIV infection events occurred in that group. FINDINGS: Between 1998 and 2021, 21 213 individuals were interviewed at least twice, contributing a total of 34 212 participant observations. In this setting, individuals had periods of HIV risk lasting less than 3 years; only 12.3% (102 of 831) of those reporting transactional sex had also reported this in the previous round. We found that life-course events such as changes in marital status, employment status, and in-migrant status were associated with these changes in HIV risk behaviour. Using life-course events, particularly ones related to changes in marital status, 23% and 30% more HIV acquisitions were identified than using HIV risk behaviours or sociodemographic information, respectively. INTERPRETATION: HIV risk changes dynamically in this population, and life-course events could be a powerful way to understand changes in HIV risk behaviour and risk of HIV acquisition.

Globally, the End TB Strategy targets an 80% reduction in TB incidence by 2030. Despite this strategy, there remains limited evidence on the incidence of TB among HIV-infected children after the test-and-treat strategies in Amhara Region. Hence, this study aimed to assess the incidence of TB and its predictors among children on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Amhara Region, which is the second largest region in Ethiopia and located in the northwestern, northeastern and north-central parts of Ethiopia. METHODS: A multicentre institution-based retrospective follow-up study was conducted on 421 HIV-infected children receiving ART from July 2014 to March 2022. The study participants were selected using simple random technique. National antiretroviral intake and follow-up forms were used to gather data through the KoBo Toolbox. Stata V.17 was used for data analysis. The Kaplan-Meier curve was applied to estimate failure time, and the log-rank test was employed to compare groups of predictors. To identify TB predictors, Gompertz regression models, both bivariable and multivariable, were constructed. Ultimately, a 95% CI adjusted HR (AHR) was calculated, and variables with a p value less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 421 children with a record completeness rate of 97.9% were analysed in the study. The TB incidence rate in children on ART was 2.16 (95% CI 1.52, 3.05) per 100 child-year observations. Anaemia at baseline (AHR: 3.83; 95% CI 1.46, 10.04), never taking TB preventive treatment (TPT) (AHR: 3.78; 95% CI 1.44, 9.94), wasting (AHR: 2.53; 95% CI 1.19, 5.38) and not initiating ART within 7 days (AHR: 2.35; 95% CI 1.15, 4.78) were significant predictors of TB in children. CONCLUSION: The incidence of TB in children on ART was relatively high. HIV-positive children presenting with anaemia, those who never took TPT, wasted children and those with late initiation of ART were prone to the occurrence of TB. Therefore, prioritising anaemia treatment, TB preventive therapy, nutritional counselling and timely initiation of ART are essential to curb the TB burden.",,pubmed

Yet, the full extent of climate change's impact on dengue remains elusive. To investigate this, we used an advanced causal inference method to 16 diverse climatic regions in the Philippines. This method is capable of detecting nonlinear and joint effects of temperature and rainfall to dengue incidence. We found that temperature consistently increased dengue incidence throughout all the regions, while rainfall effects differed depending on the variation in dry season length, a factor previously overlooked. Specifically, our results showed that regions with low variation in dry season length experience a negative impact of rainfall on dengue incidence likely due to strong flushing effect on mosquito habitats, while regions with high variation in dry season length experience a positive impact, likely due to increased mosquito breeding sites. Our findings emphasize the need for tailored prevention strategies based on local climate conditions, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.",,pubmed

The incidence of HIV is disproportionately higher in Sub-Saharan regions, particularly the Southern African sub-region, which is the most affected region and accounts for 77% of all new HIV infections in the region. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the determinants of HIV among reproductive-age women in Africa. METHODS: This study was conducted among reproductive-age women in Africa, based on secondary data obtained from the Demographic Health Survey (DHS) conducted between 2010 and 2019. The outcome variable was HIV status, while individual- and community-level variables served as potential predictors. The model fit was assessed using Akaike's Information Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion, and - 2 Log likelihood. Then, multilevel mixed-effects analysis was used. Intra-cluster correlation coefficient, median odds ratio, and proportional change in variance were used to measure heterogeneity between clusters. RESULTS: A total of 292,810 unweighted and 293,773 weighted reproductive-age women in 26 African nations were included in this study. The overall prevalence of HIV among reproductive-age women in Africa was 4.34% (95% CI: 4.2, 4.4%). The highest percentage of HIV was found in Lesotho (23.98%), followed by South Africa (19.12%), and Mozambique (14.67%). However, the lowest HIV prevalence was found in Niger (0.54%), Senegal (0.59%), and Burundi (0.79%). Southern Africa has the highest HIV burden (18.5%), followed by Eastern Africa (6.1%), while Western African countries have the lowest HIV burden. Increasing maternal age, higher maternal education, women who were unemployed, a history of multiple sexual partners, women in a union, community-level educational status, community-level wealth index, African sub-region, and urban residence were found to be independent predictors of HIV infection in Africa. CONCLUSION: The burden of HIV has remained higher, highlighting the need for targeted public health intervention strategies to prevent the transmission of HIV among key populations.",,pubmed

DESIGN: Observational longitudinal study. SETTING: Xinjiang, China, 2005-2019. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparison of TB incidence across age, period, cohort and space using socioeconomic (including gross domestic product per capita, population density, public budget revenue and total retail sales of consumer goods), public health (including the number of hospital beds, health technicians and basic medical insurance for urban residents) and environmental variables (PM2.5, mean air temperature, mean wind speed, mean relative humidity and precipitation). The relative importance of these variables to pulmonary TB (PTB) is revealed by the Q-value (0, 1), with larger values indicating that the spatial heterogeneity of the explanatory variables to PTB is more pronounced. PARTICIPANTS: All clinically diagnosed and confirmed cases in Xinjiang, China, were collected. The descriptive analysis included confirmed cases from 2005 to 2019, while cases from various districts and counties between 2011 and 2019 were subjected to further analysis. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2019, a total of 642 332 cases of PTB were reported in Xinjiang, with an average annual incidence rate of 172/100 000. The age risk of PTB presented a bimodal distribution, namely 20-24 years and the elderly (>60 years). The high prevalence of PTB was distributed in the southern part of Xinjiang. Among the influencing factors that had a greater effect on the incidence of PTB, the lower GDP per capita (Q-value=0.65) had a largest effect on PTB in Xinjiang compared with others factors (higher PM2.5: Q-value=0.56, lower health personnel: Q-value=0.49, higher average temperature: Q-value=0.47 and higher urban residents' health insurance: Q-value=0.46). The main influencing factors were heterogeneous in different regions. Furthermore, the interactions among these factors enhanced the explanatory power regarding the incidence of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying the high-risk groups, regions, influencing factors and interactions of PTB in Xinjiang, China, will expand the epidemiological knowledge of PTB in high-risk areas and potentially aid in designing targeted interventions.",,pubmed
A071,Factors associated with delay of patients with cough to tuberculosis treatment centres in selected DOTS in South-West Nigeria.,S0019-5707(23)00156-7,Olayanju O; Otaigbe I; Sodeinde K; Abiodun O; Adebiyi A,2025.0,The Indian journal of tuberculosis,"BACKGROUND: The recent gain in the fight against Tuberculosis is potentially being threatened by the delays in the diagnosis and treatment of infected patients. These patients continue to make contacts with other people in the community and spread the disease without knowing. Thus, there is a need to identify the factors associated with these delays and the possibility of mitigating them. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Ibadan, Nigeria. Three primary health care centres with high burden of tuberculosis were selected for this study. Patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis was recruited, delays for presentation at the health centres were evaluated and associated factors were determined using their clinical records and a standard questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 135 patients met the criteria for this study, and 68 (50.4%) of them were males. Two levels of delays were identified: delay between symptoms onset and presentation in health centres and delays between diagnosis and treatment commencement. Factors associated with these delays were: socio-economic status (p = 0.006), type of area of residence (p = 0.015), current smoking status (p = 0.016) and seeking treatment elsewhere before the current ailment (p = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that socio-economic factors, area of residence, cigarette smoking and previous presentation at other health facilities were factors associated with delays at DOTS centres.",,pubmed

This review aims to summarize the effects of changed atmospheric environment caused by climate change on CRD. Results indicated an increased risk of CRD (mainly COPD, asthma) associated with environmental factors, such as air pollutants, adverse meteorological conditions, extreme temperatures, sandstorms, wildfire, and atmospheric allergens. Furthermore, this association can be modified by factors such as socioeconomic status, adaptability, individual behavior, medical services. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms linking climate change and increased risk of CRD involved pulmonary inflammation, immune disorders, oxidative stress. Notably, the elderly, children, impoverished groups and people in regions with limited adaptability are more sensitive to respiratory health risks caused by climate change. This review provides a reference for understanding risk factors of CRD in the context of climate change, and calls for the necessity of adaptive strategies. Further interdisciplinary research and global collaboration are needed in the future to enhance adaptability and address climate health inequality.",,pubmed

Using the Protective Motivation Theory (PMT), we explored HIV-acquisition risk sources and perceived protective factors from AGYW and caregivers' perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During 2018, we conducted a qualitative study guided by PMT to explore factors influencing HIV acquisition among AGYW. We purposively sampled two groups of key informants, AGYW at high-risk for HIV acquisition (uninfected) and AGYW living with HIV, varied by age and place of residence (urban/rural). We conducted 34 focus group discussions with AGYW, nine with AGYW parents, and 25 key informant interviews. Data were analyzed using the framework method based on the PMT and developed from participants' narratives. RESULTS: AGYW were knowledgeable about HIV, HIV acquisition risk factors, and HIV prevention interventions. Nonetheless, few AGYW knew about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Imbalance in power relations between the genders explained inability of AGYW making safe healthy decisions, with social norms giving men power over women. Parents modelling positively influenced HIV risk behavior. Many AGYW viewed staying in school a protective factor both while at school and further for life. AGYW identified alcohol use, desire for material possessions, discounting HIV disease severity, social norms, and poverty as barriers to engaging in self-protective behaviors. Several AGYW believed that access to AGYW-focused programs would facilitate healthy sex-positive, protective behaviors. DISCUSSION: While PMT focuses on individual factors confirmed by our findings, we found HIV risk behavior to be influenced by complex contextual factors including poverty, gender inequality and cultural norms. Distinct HIV risk factors among AGYW require policy and comprehensive targeted interventions addressing violence, alcohol consumption, increased economic opportunities, educational opportunities, safe-sex practices, and PrEP scale-up which may prevent HIV in AGYW and facilitate HIV epidemic control.",,pubmed
A074,Determining the risk factors of malaria and anemia in children between 6 and 59 months using the joint generalized linear mixed model on the 2021 Nigeria Malaria Indicator Survey dataset.,10.3389/fpubh.2024.1503884,Mhelembe T; Ramroop S; Habyarimana F,2024.0,Frontiers in public health,"BACKGROUND: Malaria and anemia are significant public health concerns that contribute to child mortality in African. Despite global efforts to control the two diseases, their prevalence in high-risk regions like Nigeria remains high. Understanding socioeconomic, demographic, and geographical factors associated with malaria and anemia, is critical for effective intervention strategies. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to assess the risk factors for malaria and anemia in children under 5 years using the joint generalized linear mixed model (JGLMM). METHODS: The Nigeria Malaria Indicator Survey (NMIS) 2021 dataset was used, with a sample of 10,120 children aged 6-59 months. A two-stage sampling method was applied. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests examined factors associated with malaria and anemia prevalence. Missing data were handled using multiple imputations with chained equations (MICE). Lastly, the adjusted odds ratio was interpreted for the current study. SAS was used in analyzing the data and statistical significance was set at 5% significance level. RESULTS: The prevalence of malaria and anemia was 36.81 and 67.66%, respectively, in children between 6 and 59 months old in Nigeria. The JGLMM was used to examine malaria RDT and anemia findings in conjunction with demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic covariates. The following underlying risk factors for malaria and anemia in children were discovered in the study: region, altitude, age of child in months, toilet facility of the household, main wall material used for the house, main roof material used for the house, children under five who slept under a mosquito net, whether the child had fever in last 2 weeks before the survey took place, place of residence where the child resides, household wealth index, sex of child, and mother's education level. However, whether the mother knew of ways to prevent malaria was not statistically significant regarding anemia. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of addressing fever as a key factor for anemia and improving housing conditions to reduce malaria and anemia prevalence. Policymakers should prioritize mosquito net distribution and healthcare access, particularly in rural areas. The study's novelty lies in its handling of missing data through imputation techniques, enhancing the reliability of findings.",,pubmed

HIV,"BACKGROUND: Risk estimation is an essential component of cardiovascular disease prevention among people with HIV. We aimed to characterise how well atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk scores used in clinical guidelines perform among people with HIV globally. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study leveraging REPRIEVE data, we included participants aged 40-75 years, with low-to-moderate traditional cardiovascular risk, not taking statin therapy. REPRIEVE participants were enrolled from sites in 12 countries across Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) regions. We assessed the performance of the pooled cohort equations (PCE) risk score for ASCVD and the data-collection on adverse effects of anti-HIV drugs (D:A:D) risk score. We calculated C statistics, observed-to-expected (OE) event ratios, and Greenwood-Nam-D'Agostino goodness-of-fit (GND) statistics, overall and in subgroups by race, sex, and GBD regions (clustering low-income and middle-income countries and high-income countries). We did a recalibration for PCE risk score among people with HIV in high-income countries. REPRIEVE was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02344290. FINDINGS: We included 3893 participants, recruited between March 26, 2015, and July 31, 2019. The median age was 50 years (IQR 45-55), with 2684 (69%) male and 1209 (31%) female participants. 1643 (42%) were Black or African American, 1346 (35%) participants were White, 566 (15%) were Asian, and 338 (9%) were recorded as other race. Overall, discrimination of the PCE risk score was moderate (C statistic 0.72 [95% CI 0.68-0.76]) and calibration was good (OE event ratio 1.11; GND p=0.87). However, calibration suggested overprediction of risk in low-income and middle-income countries and corresponding underprediction in high-income countries. When restricted to high-income countries, we found underprediction (OE event ratio >1.0) among women (2.39) and Black or African American participants (1.64). Findings were similar for the D:A:D risk score (C statistic 0.71 [0.65-0.77]; OE event ratio 0.89; p=0.68). Improved calibration of the PCE risk score in high-income countries was achieved by multiplying the original score by 2.8 in Black or African American women, 2.6 in women who were not Black or African American, and 1.25 in Black or African American men. INTERPRETATION: Among the global cohort of people with HIV in REPRIEVE, the PCE risk score underpredicted cardiovascular events in women and Black or African American men in high-income countries and overpredicted cardiovascular events in low-income and middle-income countries. Underprediction in subgroups should be considered when using the PCE risk score to guide statin prescribing for cardiovascular prevention among people with HIV in high-income countries. Additional research is needed to develop risk scores accurate in predicting ASCVD among people with HIV in low-income and middle-income countries.

Though significant progress has been made towards malaria prevention and control in Nigeria, it is expected that the addition of new malaria prevention strategy, such as perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC) can contribute to a more rapid decline in malaria cases. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with malaria and anaemia among children aged 2-18 months in Osun State. METHODS: A cross-sectional household malariometric study was conducted in 80 communities across eight Local Government areas (LGAs) in Osun State. Ethical approval was obtained from Osun State Health Research Ethical Committee (OSHREC/PRS/569T312/ on the 22nd of May 2023. Malaria test positivity was determined by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and microscopy. In addition, haemoglobin levels were measured using Haemocue(R) Hb 201. Caregivers were interviewed on malaria management practices using tools adapted from Nigeria Malaria Indicator Survey. RESULTS: A total of four hundred children aged 2-18 months were assessed in this study, which was conducted in July 2023. The caregivers were mostly the biological mothers of the children (n = 387, 96.8%). Female children were 51.8% and their male counterparts 48.2% respectively. Malaria positivity rate by RDT was 36.8% and this was higher in children aged 13-18 months (48.0%) and followed by those aged 7-12 months (44.0%). By microscopy, the positivity rate was 12.5% overall, with 15.0% positivity rate among children aged 7-12 months, about 13.5% among those 13-18 months and those aged 2-6 months had the least positivity rate whether by microscopy (8.5%) or RDT (18.5%). Overall, the prevalence of severe anaemia was 4.0%, moderate was 37.3%, mild was 18.3% and the normal was 40.4% respectively. However, higher proportion of moderate anaemia (7.0-9.9 haemoglobin (g/dL)) was reported in older children. Children from medium wealth households (aOR = 0.549; 95% CI 0.306-0.986) and those from rich households (aOR = 0.543; 95% CI 0.283-1.042) had 45.0% reduction in the odds of having malaria, when compared with their counterparts from poor households. In addition, children aged 7-12 months (aOR = 2.856; 95% CI 1.524-5.354) and those aged 13-18 months (aOR = 4.269; 95% CI 2.422-7.526) had higher odds of malaria infection, respectively, when compared with children aged 2-6 months. CONCLUSION: Malaria infection and anaemia were found to be higher in older children. Household wealth and child's age were significantly associated with malaria infection. These findings would inform the positioning of PMC intervention touch-points to reduce malaria burden in young children.",,pubmed

Malaria in pregnant women leads to severe complications, including low birth weight and neonatal mortality, which can adversely affect both mother and child. This study aimed to identify the factors associated with malaria in pregnancy among women attending antenatal care (ANC) clinics in three districts of the Ashanti Region, Ghana. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1215 pregnant women selected through multi-stage sampling. Data were collected using structured questionnaires and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics, including regression analysis. RESULTS: The self-reported prevalence of at least one episode of malaria was 76.7% (95% CI [74.1-79.3%]). Age, education, marital status, income, and religion were significantly associated with the prevalence of malaria among pregnant women, with a p-value < 0.001. Pregnant women aged 17-25 years were 10.26 times more likely to have malaria compared to other age groups (aOR = 10.26, 95% CI [4.52-11.05], p = 0.000). Women with no formal education had higher odds of malaria, being 15.10 times more likely to have malaria compared to those with tertiary education (aOR = 15.10, 95% CI [7.32-16.78], p = 0.002). Women not using insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) were 20 times more likely to have malaria compared to those who used ITNs (aOR = 20.0, 95% CI [7.04-21.03], p = 0.000). CONCLUSION: Age, education, marital status, income, religion and insecticide-treated bed net (ITN) use significantly influence malaria prevalence in pregnancy. To achieve SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), particularly Target 3.1 (reducing maternal mortality) and Target 3.3 (ending malaria), the Ghana Health Service and Ministry of Health should prioritize expanding ITN distribution, educational campaigns, and targeted support for vulnerable groups to reduce malaria prevalence during pregnancy and improve maternal health outcomes.",,pubmed

Household contacts (HHC) of patients with pulmonary TB are at a high risk of LTBI due to their close proximity to source cases. OBJECTIVE: To describe the diagnosis and treatment of LTBI among HHC. DESIGN AND SETTING: This cross-sectional follow-up study was conducted in the municipality of Paulo Afonso, northeastern Brazil, between 2013 and 2022. METHODS: We retrieved secondary data from the medical records of HHC who were followed up at a specialized referral center for TB. LTBI prevalence estimates were calculated and are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: In total, 622 HHC were screened for LTBI, with 620 evaluated using the tuberculin skin test (TST). Of these, 40 (6.5%) did not return for TST reading. The overall prevalence of LTBI was 53.1% (95% CI: 49-57.1%), with a high prevalence among females and individuals aged 25-34 years. The overall LTBI treatment initiation rate was 26.1% (95%CI: 21.5-31.3%), and 64.2% (95%CI: 53.3-73.8%) of HHC who initiated treatment completed their course. CONCLUSION: This study revealed a high prevalence of LTBI among HHC, particularly among women and individuals aged 25-34 years, underscoring the ongoing TB transmission within the community. Only 26.1% of the diagnosed HHC initiated treatment, with approximately 64% completing their course. This highlights the challenges in managing LTBI and emphasizes the need for targeted screening and interventions for high-risk groups.",,pubmed

Nevertheless, these efforts have predominantly focused on pre-school and school-aged children, leaving a notable gap in understanding STH infection rates and the efficacy of these campaigns among secondary school adolescents, who have been excluded from this initiative. Our study aimed to address this critical knowledge gap by assessing soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) prevalence and contextual factors hindering effective control among adolescents in Anambra State, Nigeria. We actively engaged 443 adolescents with a mean age of 14 years in a school-based cross-sectional study in selected communities within the Anaocha Local Government Area from 8 February to 7 July 2023 following informed consent and assent procedures. Employing a stratified random sampling technique, we collected demographic data and assessed STH risk factors using a structured questionnaire hosted on the Kobo Toolbox platform. For quantitative analysis of STH infections, the Kato-Katz technique was used. Analysis was performed using SPSS version 25, incorporating descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression, with statistical significance set at p<0.05. Of the 443 (213 males (48.0%) and 230 females (52.0%) adolescents studied, the overall prevalence of STH observed was 35.2% (156/443). Ascaris lumbricoides was the prevalent STH species (16.9%), followed by Trichuris trichiura (1.4%) and hookworm (0.5%). Only light-intensity infection was observed. Mixed infections were observed in 16.5% of adolescents, involving A. lumbricoides and hookworm (10.8%), followed by A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura (3.2%) and all three STH (2.5%). The observed overall prevalence was not statistically significant with respect to gender (OR: 0.961; 95% CI: 0.651-1.420; p > 0.05) or age (OR: 0.686; 95% CI: 0.459-1.025; p>0.05). Class (grade level) (OR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.25-2.45, p = 0.003), knowledge and transmission of STH infection (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.42-0.86, p = 0.008), parental occupation (OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.35-2.67, p < 0.001), parents' literacy level (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.48-0.96, p = 0.027), and the type of toilet (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.54-3.00, p < 0.001) were all significantly correlated with STH infection. These findings highlight the role of adolescents in sustaining soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) transmission. Coupled with school-based deworming expansion, innovative improvements in water, sanitation, hygiene, and awareness can provide a cost-effective, sustainable solution for combatting STH infections in Anambra State.",,pubmed

Despite ongoing research, there is a knowledge gap regarding specific risk factors for TB within this demographic. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining the association between TB and various socio-demographic factors, including socioeconomic status, nutritional status, and environmental conditions. DATA AND METHODS: Utilizing data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 4th and 5th round (2015-16 and 2019-21), this study conducted a comprehensive cross-sectional analysis. Unadjusted and Adjusted Logistic regression is utilized to identify key factors influencing TB. Furthermore, Wagstaff decomposition analysis is applied, to quantifying the factors that contributes to the inequalities in social determinants on the wealth-related inequality observed in the prevalence of TB. RESULTS: The study observed a notable decline in TB prevalence from 1.7 to 1.2% among individuals from households having children and young adolescents aged 6-17 years. Additionally, factors like the use of unclean cooking fuel, lack of electricity, and unimproved toilet facilities were associated with increased TB prevalence. Wealth-based inequality in TB prevalence was also evident, with the burden falling disproportionately on poorer households. Unclean fuel is the most significant determinant of wealth-based inequality in TB, contributing to nearly 2/5th (18.5% in NFHS-4) of the observed inequality. Notably, gender did not significantly influence TB prevalence. CONCLUSION: The decline in TB prevalence in India correlates with improvements in socio-economic and living conditions, as evidenced by increased access to better housing, clean fuel, and sanitation facilities. The study underscores the need for integrated public health strategies that address both medical and socio-environmental determinants of TB. Improving socio-economic conditions, alongside targeted healthcare interventions, appears vital in reducing the TB burden in high-prevalence settings like India. This research emphasizes the importance of comprehensive approaches to combat pediatric TB, combining clinical care with enhancements in living standards and access to basic amenities.",,pubmed

Various factors seem to influence the risk of sarcopenia, and its prevalence may differ depending on the screening tool used. This study aimed to (i) Screen the risk of sarcopenia in PLHIV using the SARC-F and SARCCalf and identify associated factors; (ii) Analyze the agreement between the instruments in PLHIV. METHODS: Cross-sectional study including PLHIV taking antiretroviral therapy. The authors assessed sarcopenia risk using the SARC-F and SARCCalf tools with >/=4 and >/=11 cutoff points, respectively, and a wide spectrum of variables was analyzed. RESULTS: Participated 76 patients (44.9 +/- 12.7 years). Sarcopenia risk, according to the SARC-F, was 27.6 % and was associated with socioeconomic status (p = 0.004), smoking (p = 0.001), disease status (p < 0.001), opportunistic infections (p = 0.001), CD4 T-cell count (p < 0.001), Handgrip Strength (HGS) (p < 0.001), and Gait Speed (GS) (p = 0,001). Using the SARCCalf, sarcopenia risk was 36.8 % and was associated with work activity (p = 0.029), socioeconomic status (p = 0.004), smoking (p = 0.009), disease status (p < 0.001), opportunistic infections (p = 0.015), CD4 T-cell count (p = 0.002), HGS (p = 0.001), Appendicular Skeletal Muscle Mass Index (ASMMI) (p = 0.009), and GS (p < 0.001). The agreement between tools was moderate (k = 0.49). CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia risk, as determined by both tools, was higher in low-income PLHIV with opportunistic infections, CD4 T-cell count </= 200 cells/mm(3), low HGS, and low GS, and lower in asymptomatic and non-smoking individuals. The authors recommend investigating these factors in hospital and outpatient settings. The SARCCalf proved to be more appropriate for screening sarcopenia risk in PLHIV.",,pubmed

By employing instrumental variable techniques and conducting various robustness checks to address potential endogeneity concerns, our results consistently show that communities with access to water resources experience greater crop diversification and reduced sharecropping compared to those with limited access. This effect is particularly pronounced among male-headed, youth-headed, and smallholder farm households in the northern zone. While CWR may not be the sole determinant of crop diversification and sharecropping, it plays a significant role in shaping adaptive strategies amid drought challenges. Moreover, we identify committed time as a critical mechanism through which CWR influences these outcomes. Our findings offer valuable insights for policymakers aiming to allocate resources effectively, especially for vulnerable populations, in enhancing resilience to climate change-induced water scarcity.",,pubmed
A084,Completed suicide risk factors among people living with HIV in Hunan Province identified through a psychological autopsy case-control study.,10.1038/s41598-024-82101-7,Yang Z; Chen X; Chen X; Xie Z; Luo D,2024.0,Scientific reports,"Accumulating evidence has shown an increased risk of suicide among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). However, few studies have explored the risk factors associated with completed suicide among PLWHA. This study aimed to identify the characteristics and causes of completed suicide among PLWHA to guide future targeted suicide prevention and intervention programs. A 1:1 matched case-control psychological autopsy study was conducted among PLWHA in Hunan Province. We recruited 63 PLWHA who died by suicide from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2019, and 63 living controls matched for age, gender, and employment. Two informants for each participant were interviewed to collect data on participants' sociodemographic characteristics, depressive symptoms, HIV-related stress, hopelessness, and social support. The median survival time from HIV diagnosis to completed suicide was 3.9 months (IQR: 0.57-14.13). Most completed suicides occurred within six months of HIV diagnosis (71.4%), with poisoning (34.9%) and hanging (22.2%) as the primary methods. After controlling for confounding factors, we identified four risk factors of completed suicide: not receiving antiretroviral treatment (OR = 6.805; 95% CI: 1.227 to 37.738), receiving low-income subsidy (OR = 16.272; 95% CI: 3.245 to 81.598), HIV-related stress (OR = 1.332; 95% CI: 1.089 to 1.629), and hopelessness (OR = 2.910; 95% CI: 1.378 to 6.144). PLWHA are at a high risk of suicide within the first six months of HIV diagnosis, indicating an urgent need for immediate suicide screening and timely intervention. Suicide risk is affected by multiple factors, including sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological factors, indicating the need for a multifactorial approach to suicide prevention, which may involve early initiation of ART treatment and provision of economic and psychosocial support.",,pubmed

However, shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic, an unpredictable malaria resurgence was observed in almost all malaria-endemic areas of the country, although the exact cause of which has not yet been identified. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate malaria burden and associated risk factors in one of the endemic zones of Ethiopia. METHODS: A health facility-based retrospective and cross-sectional study design was conducted in the Kaffa zone, southwest of Ethiopia. Hence, a seven-year retrospective data on malaria positivity rate, interventional activities undertaken in the area, and climatic variables were collected from the patient's medical records, district health bureau, and meteorological institute, respectively. For the cross-sectional study, all malaria-suspected patients seeking medication at the health facilities in the Kaffa Zone administrative centre, Bonga town, during the study period (January-June 2024), were recruited in the study. Data on the patient's socio-demographic, socio-economic, behavioural, health facilities and environmental factors were collected using a structured face-to-face interview questionnaire. Data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science software (SPSS) (version 26) and the statistical tools used were descriptive statistics and logistic regression models. A significant level was considered at p < 0.05. RESULTS: The study findings revealed a significant increment in malaria positivity trend (39.43%, n = 188,201/477,276, p < 0.0001) between July 2018 and June 2024. Also, the malaria positivity rate documented in the cross-sectional study was 50.72% (n = 315/621). Plasmodium falciparum was the dominant malaria parasite. The study identified weakened control measures (p = 0.006), limited awareness of the population (p < 001), and socio-demographic factors such as education (p = 0.037), age (p = 0.008), housing condition (p < 0.0001), low-income level (p < 001), and travel history to malaria-endemic areas (p = 0.001)] as risk factors associated with high malaria positivity rate. In addition, indoor residual spraying (IRS) and mean maximum temperature activity increased by 1 unit, and the malaria positivity rate decreased by 28 times (p < 0.0001) and 1.3 (p = 0.003), respectively. The months of July and September were strongly and positively associated with higher malaria positivity in the area (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Even though Ethiopia was able to achieve a remarkable malaria burden reduction in the past few years, the recent interrupted malaria control activities, seasonal variability, and patient and health facility-associated factors have contributed to the current high malaria positivity rate documented in Kaffa zone, Southwest Ethiopia. This urges the need for immediate community sensitization activities to enhance the awareness of malaria, besides designing integrated vector control interventional strategies to tackle the current alarming situation in the zone.",,pubmed

METHODS: : This was a cross-sectional study using data from a sample of TWT with HIV-positive serology and detectable viral load (VL), between 2019 and 2021. The dependent and independent variables were, respectively: viral load measurement, socioeconomic/demographic characteristics; alcohol/drug use; and self-perceived mental health. Poisson regression with robust variance was used. RESULTS: : A total of 425 TWT tested positive for HIV and underwent VL measurement, 179 (42.0%) presented detectable viremia. Factors positively associated with detectability were: younger age (PR=2.26; 95%CI 1.13;4.51), poorer housing conditions (PR=2.72; 95%CI 1.30;5.68) and poor/very poor mental health (PR=1.70; 95%CI 1.08;2.66). The use of antiretroviral drugs was a protective factor against detectability (PR=0.29; 95%CI 0.30;0.61). CONCLUSION: The factors associated with unsuppressed viral load highlight vulnerability related to gender identity that have a negative impact, despite the majority of participants being on antiretroviral therapy (ART). MAIN RESULTS: People aged 20-29 who were homeless or unstable and those who reported poor or very poor mental health were more likely to have a detectable viral load. ARV drug use was a protective factor. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: The identification of predictors for detectable viral load enables the design of appropriate strategies for monitoring and linking vulnerable people to health services, ensuring effective implementation. PERSPECTIVES: It is necessary to develop educational strategies that take into account important social issues to improve awareness about undetectable viral load in HIV prevention among the transgender population, especially among younger people.",,pubmed

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences","BACKGROUND: Climate change is expected to disrupt weather patterns across the world, exposing older adults to more intense and frequent periods of hot weather. Meanwhile, lab-based studies have established a causal relationship between ambient temperature and cognitive abilities, suggesting the expected rise in temperature may influence older adults' cognitive functioning. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether, and to what extent, the temperature variations in older adults' own homes-which unlike lab settings are under their control-influence their cognitive functioning. Our objective was to provide proof of concept that home ambient temperature influences self-reported ability to maintain attention in older adults. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal observational study, continuously monitoring the home ambient temperature and self-reported difficulty keeping attention for 12 months in 47 of community-dwelling older adults living in Boston, Massachusetts. RESULTS: We observed a U-shaped relationship between home ambient temperature at the time of assessment and the odds ratio (OR) of reporting difficulty keeping attention such that the OR was lowest between 20 degrees C and 24 degrees C and doubled when moving away from this range by 4 degrees C in either direction. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that even under the current climate, a considerable portion of older adults encounter indoor temperatures detrimental to their cognitive abilities. Climate change may exacerbate this problem, particularly among low-income and underserved older adults. Addressing this issue in public health and housing policy is essential to building climate resiliency in this vulnerable population.",,pubmed

However, limited data are available on social and behavioral aspects of dengue outbreak. We aimed to fill this gap and wish to study socioeconomic, demographic, and behavioral factors associated with dengue outbreak in the Gorakhpur region of eastern Uttar Pradesh, India. Methods: This retrospective observational study was conducted among dengue patients discharged from hospital. Data on sociodemographic, economic, and behavioral factors of dengue were collected telephonically using a structured questionnaire. Continuous and categorical variables were reported as mean +/- SD and numbers (%), respectively. Logistic regression analysis was done to establish association between patient's characteristics, awareness, and preventive behavior. Results: Age group 19-45 years 156/232, males 159/232, urban residents 142/232, residing in pucca house 187/232, and from lower-income families 149/232 were mostly affected in this outbreak. Patients spent a median of Indian national rupees 20,000 on treatment. Only 10.8% of patients had Ayushman health insurance cards. Awareness about dengue infection was found in approximately 43% patients. Literates, middle income group, and professionals/semiprofessionals were significantly more aware about dengue disease, mosquito bite, and treatment than their counterparts. Travel history was significantly associated with dengue infection in the males of 19-45 years age group belonging to rural areas. Use of mosquito repellent, nets, wearing full sleeve clothes were significantly less in rural residents while barefoot walking was more frequently observed in this population. Use of mosquito repellent was significantly associated with income, and these were observed more in the middle-income group. Conclusion: People with low education level, residing in urban areas, residing in pucca houses, who travel frequently, and who belong to lower-income groups were majorly affected by this dengue outbreak. Less dengue awareness and not following preventive practices were found in them. Targeted health education campaigns in urban setting could prevent dengue and economic burden on these vulnerable groups.",,pubmed

Anthropogenic air pollution has resulted in trapping heat, contributing to global warming, which contributes to worsening air pollution through facilitating oxidizing of air constituents. It is becoming more evident that the effects of climate change, such as air pollution and ambient temperatures, are interconnected with each other and other environmental factors. While the relationship between climate change components and cardiovascular disease is well documented in the literature, their interaction with one another along with individuals' biological and social risk factors is yet to be elucidated. In this review, we summarize that pathophysiological mechanisms by ambient temperatures directly affect cardiovascular health and describe the most vulnerable subgroups, defined by age, sex, race, and socioeconomic factors. Finally, we provide guidance on the importance of integrating climate, environmental, social, and health data into common platforms to inform researchers and policies.",,pubmed

This study investigated the prevalence and intensity of S.mansoni infection, and contributing factors in Alamata district of Tigray Region, Northern Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted and 1762 participants were enrolled from five clusters in Alamata district. A questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic data and risk factors. Stool samples were examined using Kato-katz technique to determine the prevalence and intensity of infection. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. Median, inter quartile range (IQR), mean, frequency, and percentage were used to descriptively summarize data. The Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare the differences in mean rank of egg load between different groups. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between the odds of being infected with S.mansoni and the different socio-demographic and other factors. The strength of these associations was reported using odds ratio with corresponding 95% confidence intervals, and a P-value below 5% was used to report statistical significance. RESULTS: Out of 1762 residents included in the study 941 (53.4%) were females. The age varied from 5-80 years, with a median age of 25 years (IQR = 27), the overall prevalence of S.mansoni was 21.5% with males accounting for 26% (204/821) of the infections. The proportion of infection was higher among the age groups of 15-19 and 20-29 years at 32.7% and 33.1%, respectively. The mean egg count among the infected study participants was 146.82 eggs per gram of feces (epg) +/- (243.17 SD). Factors significantly associated with increased odds of infection were living in Waja cluster (AOR:8.9; 95% CI, 3.5-23.2; P< 0.001); being in the age groups 10-14 (AOR:6.0, 95% CI: 3.1-11.7, P<0.001), 15-19 (AOR:5.8, 95% CI:2.8-12.2, P<0.001), and 20-29 (AOR:3.5, 95% CI:1.8-6.8; P<0.001) years; having direct contact with water while crossing river (AOR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.5-3.8, P<0.001); and swimming (AOR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.01-2.0, P = 0.035). CONCLUSION: The study indicates a notable S.mansoni burden in the area, driven by various risk factors.

As hitherto rural areas transition into semi-urban environments, this study investigated the prevalence of falciparum malaria and associated risk factors in two rapidly urbanizing districts in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. METHODS: A cross-sectional, hospital-based study was conducted at Agona and Mankranso Government Hospitals located within the Sekyere South and Ahafo Ano Southwest districts respectively, in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Five microL of venous blood was obtained from suspected malaria patients and tested for malaria using rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Data on socio-demographic factors, clinical symptoms, and housing characteristics were collected using a structured questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to identify risk factors associated with malaria. RESULTS: A total of 1739 participants were enrolled in the study between January and June 2021 with median age of 22 years (IQR = 6-36). Overall malaria prevalence was 24.8%. Compared to > 30-year-olds, children between 0 and 5 years (aOR = 3.36) and those aged between 6 and 14 (aOR = 6.71) were three and six times more likely to test positive for malaria, respectively. Similarly, farming (aOR = 1.74), compared to other occupations, living close to stagnant water (aOR = 1.34), experiencing chills (aOR = 1.5), and vomiting (aOR = 1.93) were associated with increased odds of malaria infection. Having roofing ceiling (aOR = 0.66) and screened doors (aOR = 0.75) were associated with decreased risk of malaria. However, sleeping under insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), using mosquito coils/repellents, and indoor residual spraying (IRS) were not statistically significantly associated with infection. CONCLUSION: Children between 0 and 5 years and those aged between 6 and 14 years continue to shoulder the highest burden of malaria. Efforts to improve housing characteristics such as installation of roofing ceiling, screening doors, and clearing potential mosquito breeding sites should be encouraged in these rapidly urbanizing areas.",,pubmed

Given the importance of the Federal Medical Center, Makurdi, as a key healthcare provider in the region, it is crucial to understand the prevalence and factors associated with these diseases within this setting. This study is designed to address this need, aiming to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of malaria and hepatitis B and C among patients at the Federal Medical Center, Makurdi. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study design was employed, involving the meticulous analysis of patient records and diagnostic data from the Federal Medical Center, Makurdi. Data on malaria and hepatitis B and C prevalence were collected from laboratory reports and patient interviews. Socioeconomic information, including income, education level, and healthcare access, was also gathered. Statistical analyses were performed with utmost care to identify associations between disease prevalence and risk factors. RESULTS: The study examined 248 patients at the Federal Medical Centre, Makurdi, assessing malaria, Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and Hepatitis C virus (HCV). Malaria prevalence was 52.4%, with higher rates in males (57.7%) than females (47.2%). HBsAg prevalence was 6.9%, and HCV was 4.8%, with no significant differences by sex or marital status. Income level impacted HCV rates, with middle-income individuals showing higher prevalence (21.4%). Malaria was most common in the 26-40 age group (35.4%). DISCUSSION: The findings underscore the need for targeted public health interventions. Enhanced access to preventive measures, such as insecticide-treated nets and safer blood transfusion practices, and educational disease prevention programs, are essential. Addressing socioeconomic disparities is crucial for effective disease control. CONCLUSION: To mitigate the burden of malaria and hepatitis B and C at the Federal Medical Center, Makurdi, a multifaceted approach is required. Improving preventive measures, healthcare access, and addressing socioeconomic determinants will reduce disease prevalence and improve patient outcomes.",,pubmed

Despite many studies of HIV in blood donors, no studies have evaluated the factors that contribute to stigma surrounding this illness following notification process and counseling provided by blood centers. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted between 2016 and 2017. Persons with HIV were invited to return to the blood center for an audio computer-assisted interview after participation in an HIV risk factor assessment study conducted from 2007 to 2016. The questionnaire was based on HIV risk interviews developed by the US CDC, with modifications appropriate to the Brazilian setting which aimed to evaluate their follow-up activities, perceptions of HIV stigma and discrimination, and the quality of counseling and notification after the donation that tested positive for HIV. Response frequencies and adjusted odds ratios from multivariable logistic regression analyses are reported. RESULTS: 268 HIV-positive blood donors agreed to participate in the study. Almost all participants, 262 (97 %), rated as very important or important the blood center counseling experience in their decision to seek health care. One-hundred-five (39 %) participants reported none to low levels of stigma, and 163 (61 %) participants moderate stigma. Individuals reporting heterosexual orientation (OR=2.13, 95 % CI [1.08‒4.22]) and healthcare-seeking behavior (OR=2.46, 95 % CI [1.10‒5.48]) had significantly increased odds of reporting moderate levels of stigma.

In Brazil, the most studied endemic area for the disease is the Amazon region. This study aims to analyze temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal patterns of malaria in the extra-Amazon region of Brazil over a 22-year period. METHODS: We conducted a time-series study from 2001 to 2022, encompassing both autochthonous and imported cases. Time trend analysis was employed to assess fluctuations in incidence rates over the years. Spatial clusters of infection risk were identified using the Local Moran Index and Kulldorff's scan. RESULTS: A total of 18,633 malaria cases were identified in the extra-Amazon region, including 1,980 autochthonous, 13,836 imported, and 2,817 of unknown origin. During the first period (2001-2011), 1,348 autochthonous and 9,124 imported cases were reported. In the second period (2012-2022), there were 632 autochthonous and 4,712 imported cases. The state of Espirito Santo exhibited a decreasing trend but maintained the highest incidence rates throughout the study. The number of municipalities at high risk for autochthonous cases declined, with Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais, and Piaui having the most municipalities with high rates. For imported cases, the federative units with the highest numbers in both periods were Ceara, Distrito Federal, Goias, Minas Gerais, Piaui, and Parana.

Despite ongoing efforts to control and eradicate TB, various factors including socioeconomic issues, policy modifications, and unexpected public health crises like COVID-19 pandemic have posed new obstacles to achieving TB elimination. This study aims to analyze the changes in global tuberculosis burden over the past 32 years, and provide scientific support for global initiatives targeting the eradication of TB in the post-pandemic period. METHODS: The data for this study were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 database, with age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), prevalence rate (ASPR), mortality rate (ASDR), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) as the primary assessment indicators. Dynamic changes in the TB burden were analyzed by estimating the annual percentage changes (EAPCs). The attributable ratios of six main risk factors to TB burden were calculated, and the correlation between the Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) and the TB burden was analyzed using Pearson correlation tests. RESULTS: The global TB incidence decreased from 8.6 million cases in 1990 to 8.4 million cases in 2021, with a corresponding decline in deaths. However, the TB burden remains higher among men than women. The highest incidence and mortality rates were observed in the age group of 15-69 years, with a notable gender disparity, especially in Eastern Europe. These rates were generally elevated in low-income and lower-middle-income regions, with significantly higher Age-Standardized Incidence Rates and Age-Standardized Death Rates in males compared to females. A significant negative correlation was found between SDI values and TB burden. Analyzing risk factors from the Global Burden of Disease study, it was determined that globally, dietary risks, high body-mass index, high fasting plasma glucose, low physical activity, tobacco, and alcohol use were the main contributors to TB age-standardized Disability-Adjusted Life Years, with tobacco and alcohol use having the most significant impact. Analysis of risk factors suggests that tailored public health interventions for specific genders and regions can effectively lessen the TB burden.",,pubmed

We utilized data from the 2014 International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR) surveys from Malawi in which blood samples of all individuals from selected households in Blantyre, Thyolo and Chikhwawa were tested for Pf parasitemia. We assessed household SEP and potential mediators - housing quality, food security, education status of household heads, and use of long-lasting Insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) and nutritional status. We conducted causal mediation analyses to assess the proportion of SEP effect that is attributed to each mediator and combination of mediators. The mediation analysis shows that during the rainy season, improved housing and educational attainment explained 39.4% and 17.0% of the SEP effect on Pf infection, respectively, and collectively 66.4%. In the dry season, housing, educational attainment, and LLIN usage collectively mediated 33.4% of SEP's effect with individual contributions of 15.6%, 11.2%, and 3.8%, respectively. Nutrition also played a role, particularly for children, mediating 9.2% of SEP's effect in the rainy season and 3.7% in the dry season. The study concluded that multifaceted interventions targeting housing, education, LLIN usage, and nutrition are vital to reducing socioeconomic disparities in Pf infection risk in the Southern region of Malawi.",,pubmed

Outcomes for PLWH on modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens are not well documented. We conducted an observational study to determine the outcomes and predictors of anemia after ART initiation in Tanzania. We enrolled and followed ART-naive PLWH and HIV-uninfected individuals at three clinics in Tanzania. We grouped participants into four longitudinal categories based on hemoglobin concentration measured at baseline and 6 months after ART initiation (normal, resolved anemia, incident anemia, and persistent anemia) and followed them for 24 months. There were 991 study participants (494 PLWH, 497 HIV uninfected). After 6 months of ART, 33.9% of PLWH had persistent anemia and 9.9% had incident anemia compared with 12.6% and 9.6% for HIV-uninfected controls. Female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.62; 95% CI: 1.91-6.75) and low income (aOR: 3.10; 95% CI: 1.36-7.20) were strong predictors of persistent anemia for both PLWH and HIV-uninfected individuals. For PLWH, having a CD4+ T cell count of less than 350 cells/mm3 (aOR: 0.34; 95% Cl: 0.15-0.73) was significantly associated with anemia resolution. Mortality was higher for PLWH who had persistent anemia or incident anemia than for PLWH who had normal hemoglobin or improved anemia (hazard ratio: 4.0, 95% Cl 1.3-12.2). One-third of adults in Tanzania had persistent anemia after 6 months on ART, and persistent anemia was associated with increased mortality. PLWH with persistent or incident anemia after 6 months on modern ART deserve close follow-up, particularly women and low-income adults.",,pubmed

Using an ethnographic approach, we applied the concept of disease situations to explore how inhabitants' social and spatial situatedness affected their capacity to respond to the pandemic. Our results show that for some populations in Lima, the risk to develop COVID-19 did not emerge suddenly; it could be traced back to situations of living under subsistence models, relying on unstable sources of income, facing food insecurity, depending on certain mechanisms of social protection, residing in precarious living environments and lacking access to quality health care. These populations did not only have less resources to adjust to changes in daily life induced by the pandemic; they were also forced to constantly weigh the risk of COVID-19 against other pressing needs and potentially face increased risks when control measures were actually followed. Pre-existing social networks played fundamental roles as sources of emotional and material support. The lens of disease situations can help to identify and explain spatial and social configurations that enhance vulnerability, as well as resilience mechanisms that are in place to deal with crises. This perspective could inform the design of contextualised prevention and response strategies around health risks in cities as diverse as Lima, whilst building on existing resources at local levels.",,pubmed

METHODS: PrEP1519 is a prospective, multicenter cohort study demonstrating the effectiveness of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among AMSM and ATGW aged from 15 to 19 years in three Brazilian state capitals. The analyses were performed with baseline cohort data, including 1,418 adolescents enrolled from 2019 to 2021. The outcome studied was CAS in the last six months, and the potentially associated factors were sociodemographic, behavioral, healthcare, and history of violence and discrimination. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were conducted. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated. RESULTS: Most of the participants were AMSM (91.5%), aged 18 to 19 years (75.9%), Black (40.5%), with secondary or higher education in progress (92.7%), with CAS during the first sexual intercourse (54.2%), sexual initiation before the age of 14 (43.4%), and history of group sex (24.6%) and transactional sex (14.6%). The prevalence of CAS in the last six months was 80.6% (95%CI 78.5%-82.6%). Adolescents who reported condomless first sexual intercourse (aPR: 1.18; 95%CI 1.10-1.25), use of psychoactive substances (aPR: 1.09; 95%CI 1.03-1.16), and transactional sex (aPR: 1.11; 95%CI 1.04-1.20) had a higher prevalence of CAS in the last six months. We also found that those aged 15 to 17 years had a higher prevalence of CAS than those aged 18 to 19 (aPR: 1.07; 95%CI 0.99-1.13). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CAS was high among AMSM and ATGW, being associated with practices that may increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Therefore, it is recommended to strengthen sexual health programs for young people that address the issue of sexuality and STI prevention, as well as to expand access to preventive methods, such as condoms and PrEP.",,pubmed

HIV,"BACKGROUND: Extreme weather events pose a risk to health and disproportionately affect vulnerable groups, such as people living with HIV. We aimed to investigate the effects of extreme weather events on HIV testing uptake, HIV treatment and care, and HIV transmission. METHODS: For this systematic review, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO for peer-reviewed studies published between database inception and Aug 31, 2023. Eligible studies were English-language qualitative, quantitative observational (retrospective, prospective, cross-sectional, longitudinal, case-control, and cohort), and mixed-method studies, and randomised controlled trials related to HIV and extreme weather events. We excluded reviews, mathematical models, and case reports. After exporting the search results, two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified articles, reviewing the full text of those that met the inclusion criteria. We used systems thinking to develop a framework linking extreme weather events and HIV and summarised the results using thematic narrative synthesis. FINDINGS: Of the 6126 studies identified by the search, 27 met the inclusion criteria and were eligible for analysis, of which 19 were quantitative, six were qualitative, and two were mixed-method studies. We identified five main themes linking extreme weather events to HIV: economic and livelihood conditions (12 studies), psychosocial factors (19 studies), infrastructure damage and operational challenges (17 studies), migration and displacement (ten studies), and associated medical conditions and health-care needs (12 studies). We showed how these themes interact in complex ways, resulting in a reduction in uptake of HIV testing, interruption of HIV care and subsequent disease progression, altered risk behaviours, and an increased prevalence of HIV. INTERPRETATION: Extreme weather events are associated with disruptions to HIV services. Owing to the design of the included studies, we could not establish a causal relationship between extreme weather events and HIV incidence, highlighting a research gap. Appropriate adaptations and mitigation policies that protect the health and wellbeing of people living with HIV during and after extreme weather events are warranted. Such actions will be crucial to achieving the UNAIDS goal of ending HIV as a public health threat by 2030. FUNDING: None.",,pubmed

Several studies on the prevalence of malaria among pregnant women in Ghana have been conducted in various parts of the country, yielding evidence pointing to intra- and inter-regional variations. The current study assessed the prevalence, risk factors, and sociodemographic predictors of malaria among pregnant women in the Bono East Region of Ghana. METHODS: This multicentre hospital-based study employed a mixed-method cross-sectional design. A multistage sampling technique was used to select seven health facilities and recruited 1452 pregnant women who attended ANC at seven selected health facilities. Haematological examination, a structured closed-ended questionnaire, in-depth interviews (IDIs), and focus group discussions (FGDs) were used to obtain relevant data. Quantitative data were analysed with STATA 14 (StataCorp, College Station, USA). Likewise, the four-step thematic analysis was used to analyse qualitative data. A significant level was set at (p < 0.05) at a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: The ages of the pregnant women at enrolment ranged between 17 and 40 years, with a mean (SD) of 28.8 +/- 3.73 (95% C.I: 28.63-29.02). The overall prevalence of malaria infection among pregnant women was 10.8% (95% CI: 9.32-12.56). Presence of farm or domestic animals, living close to drainage tunnels, living near overgrown vegetation, not married, not having formal education, living in extended-type households, living in compound-type households, mud and thatch households, mud and iron sheet households, primigravidae, multiparity, first-time pregnant women, second-time, third-time, fourth-time, and fifth-time ANC visits, blood groups A, B, and AB were independent factors or predictors significantly associated with increased risk of malaria. CONCLUSION: The current study revealed an approximately 10.8% prevalence of malaria among pregnant women. The prevalence revealed, was, however, higher than the national prevalence of 8.6%. The high prevalence of malaria, associated risk factors, and sociodemographic and maternal predictors highlight the need to strengthen screening for malaria, administer treatments, monitor maternal and foetal health, and provide education and counselling.",,pubmed

The transmission of dengue is contingent upon various factors, among which climate variability plays a significant role. However, there remains substantial uncertainty regarding the underlying mechanisms. This study aims to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of dengue risk and to quantify the associated risk factors in Valle del Cauca, Colombia, from 2001 to 2019. To achieve this, a spatio-temporal Bayesian hierarchical model was developed, integrating delayed and non-linear effects of climate variables, socio-economic factors, along with spatio-temporal random effects to account for unexplained variability. The results indicate that average temperature is positively associated with dengue risk 0-2 months later, showing a 35% increase in the risk. Similarly, high precipitation levels lead to increased risk approximately 2-3 months later, while relative humidity showed a constant risk within a 6 months-lag. These findings could be valuable for local health authorities interested in developing early warning systems to predict future risks in advance.",,pubmed

This narrative review aims to summarise the current knowledge about fracture risk among post-menopausal WLHIV in particular looking at hormonal changes, combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), lifestyle factors, and psychosocial implications. We also profiled a summary of the significant, recent studies of post-menopausal WLHIV residing in low-income countries (LIC). METHODS: A thorough search of the literature was performed across PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar, focussing on studies published between 2000 and 2024. Inclusion criteria entailed original research, reviews, and meta-analyses addressing bone mineral density (BMD), fracture incidence, and related risk factors in post-menopausal WLHIV. RESULTS: The review identified 223 relevant studies. Post-menopausal WLHIV exhibit significantly lower BMD and higher fracture rates compared to both HIV-negative post-menopausal women and pre-menopausal WLHIV. cART, particularly tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), contributes to reduced BMD. Menopausal status exacerbates this risk through decreased oestrogen levels, leading to increased bone resorption. Moreover, lifestyle choices such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and low physical activity are more prevalent in PWHIV, which further elevates fracture risk. Different psychosocial factors may make WLWHIV more vulnerable at this stage of their life, such as depression, isolation, stigma, and housing and nutritional issues. Women living in LICs face a variety of challenges in accessing HIV care. There are gaps in research related to the prevalence of osteoporosis and bone loss in post-menopausal WLHIV in LICs. CONCLUSION: Post-menopausal women living with HIV face a significantly higher risk of bone loss and fractures due to the combined effects of HIV and menopause. Antiretroviral therapy (particularly TDF), lifestyle factors, and psychosocial challenges exacerbate this risk. There is a need for careful selection of cART, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and emerging treatments such as Abaloparatide. A holistic approach including lifestyle changes and psychosocial support is crucial to reduce fracture risk in WLHIV, especially in low-income countries.",,pubmed

Socio-economic conditions contribute to persisting endemicity of these infectious diseases. As such, examining these underlying factors may help identify gaps in implementation of control programs. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) and investigate the role of socio-economic and risk factors in the persistence of these diseases in endemic communities in the Philippines. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involving a total of 1,152 individuals from 386 randomly-selected households was conducted in eight municipalities in Mindanao, the Philippines. Participants were asked to submit fecal samples which were processed using the Kato-Katz technique to check for intestinal helminthiases. Moreover, each household head participated in a questionnaire survey investigating household conditions and knowledge, attitude, and practices related to intestinal helminthiases. Associations between questionnaire responses and intestinal helminth infection were assessed. RESULTS: Results demonstrated an overall schistosomiasis prevalence of 5.7% and soil-transmitted helminthiasis prevalence of 18.8% in the study population. Further, the household questionnaire revealed high awareness of intestinal helminthiases, but lower understanding of routes of transmission. Potentially risky behaviors such as walking outside barefoot and bathing in rivers were common. There was a strong association between municipality and prevalence of helminth infection. Educational attainment and higher ""practice"" scores (relating to practices which are effective in controlling intestinal helminths) were inversely associated with soil-transmitted helminth infection. CONCLUSION: Results of the study showed remaining high endemicity of intestinal helminthiases in the area despite ongoing control programs. Poor socio-economic conditions and low awareness about how intestinal helminthiases are transmitted may be among the factors hindering success of intestinal helminth control programs in the provinces of Agusan del Sur and Surigao del Norte. Addressing these sustainability gaps could contribute to the success of alleviating the burden of intestinal helminthiases in endemic areas.",,pubmed

Therefore, it is important to regularly measure the extent of UTIs and ABR in the most susceptible populations. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of UTIs, associated factors, bacterial causal agents, and their antibiotic susceptibility profile among PLHIV in central Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted to recruit 688 PLHIV by a simple random sampling method. Background information was gathered through interviews, while clinical information was gathered from recent information sheets of patient charts using organized, pretested, and validated study tools. Midstream urine was collected aseptically and transported to the Microbiology Laboratory of Aklilu Lemma Institute of Pathobiology within 4 h of collection, maintaining its cold chain. Standard conventional microbial culture methods and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry were used to identify the bacterial isolates at the species level. Kirby Bauer's disk diffusion method was used to determine the antibiotic susceptibility profile of the bacterial isolates based on the interpretation guidelines of the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute. Logistic regression models were used to examine factors associated with the occurrence of UTIs among PLHIV attending selected hospitals in Addis Ababa, and Adama. RESULTS: Out of 688 PLHIVs involved in the current study, 144 (20.9%) were positive for UTIs, whereas the majority were asymptomatic for UTIs. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, only HIV RNA >/= 200 copies/ml [AOR = 12.24 (95% CI, 3.24, 46.20), p < 0.01] and being symptomatic for UTIs during the study period [AOR = 11.57 (95% CI, 5.83, 22.97), p < 0.01] were associated with the occurrence of UTIs. The dominant bacterial species isolated were Escherichia coli (E. coli; n = 65; 43%), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis; n = 16; 10.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae; n = 11; 7.3%). Over half of the E. coli isolates were resistant to antibiotics such as gentamicin (GM; n = 44; 67.7%), amikacin (AN; n = 46; 70.8%), nalidixic acid (NA; n = 42; 64.6%), ciprofloxacin (CIP; n = 40; 61.5%), and azithromycin (AZM; n = 45; 69.2%). All of the K. pneumoniae isolates (n = 11; 100%), (n = 6; 54.5%), and (n = 7; 63.6%) were resistant to [amoxicillin as well as amoxicillin + clavulanic acid], ceftriaxone, and sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim, respectively. All the Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) isolates were resistant to cefoxitin, which implies methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of UTIs and antibiotic resistance revealed in the current study needs public health interventions such as educating the population about preventive measures and the importance of early treatment of UTIs. Our findings also highlight the need to provide UTI screening services for PLHIV, and healthcare providers should adopt antibiotic stewardship programs to promote and ensure their appropriate and judicious use.",,pubmed

In the pediatric population, the knowledge about the factors that lead to the abandonment of TB treatment is limited, especially in regions with a high prevalence of the disease. This study aimed to identify the prevalence and risk factors associated with TB treatment abandonment in children and adolescents. A cross-sectional study was carried out using data obtained from TB notifications from the Sao Paulo State Tuberculosis Patient Control System, Brazil, for individuals aged between 0 and 18 years, from January 2009 to December 2019. The crude and adjusted prevalence ratios were estimated with a 95% confidence interval, using the Poisson regression model to identify associations between the outcome of treatment abandonment and the sociodemographic, clinical-epidemiological, diagnostic and therapeutic factors of TB cases with complete information. Of the 12,256 cases analyzed, 941 individuals abandoned treatment. The highest prevalence rate of treatment abandonment occurs among Black or brown adolescents, those over 11 years of age and those deprived of their liberty. Other characteristics associated with treatment abandonment include: being a person living with HIV/AIDS, having a history of previous TB treatment, using illicit substances and using a self-administered TB treatment regimen. Knowing the profile of the patient most likely to abandon TB treatment makes it possible to devise more effective strategies focused on adherence to drug treatment.",,pubmed

We sought to describe the prevalence of HIV, nutritional disorders, and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) among members of tuberculosis-affected households in 3 African countries. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A part of a multicountry cohort study, we screened for tuberculosis, HIV, nutritional disorders (underweight, anaemia, overweight/obesity), and NCDs (diabetes, hypertension, and chronic lung disease) among members of tuberculosis-affected households aged >/=10 years in Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. We describe the prevalence of these conditions, their co-occurence within individuals (multimorbidity) and household-level clustering. Of 2,109 household contacts recruited, 93% (n = 1,958, from 786 households) had complete data and were included in the analysis. Sixty-two percent were female, median age was 27 years, and 0.7% (n = 14) were diagnosed with co-prevalent tuberculosis. Six percent of household members (n = 120) had previous tuberculosis, 15% (n = 294) were living with HIV, 10% (n = 194) had chronic lung disease, and 18% (n = 347) were anaemic. Nine percent of adults (n = 127) had diabetes by HbA1c criteria, 32% (n = 439) had hypertension. By body mass index criteria, 18% household members (n = 341) were underweight while 29% (n = 549) were overweight or obese. Almost half the household members (n = 658) had at least 1 modifiable tuberculosis risk factor. Sixty-one percent of adults (n = 822) had at least 1 chronic condition, 1 in 4 had multimorbidity. While most people with HIV knew their status and were on treatment, people with NCDs were usually undiagnosed and untreated. Limitations of this study include use of point-of-care HbA1c for definition of diabetes and definition of hypertension based on single-day measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Households affected by tuberculosis also face multiple other health challenges. Integrated approaches to tuberculosis screening may represent an opportunity for identification and treatment, including prioritisation of individuals at highest risk for tuberculosis to receive preventive therapy.",,pubmed

Little is known about FI among PWH in southern or non-urban settings. We examined FI prevalence, risk factors, and access to services in a southeastern HIV clinic. Among PWH in the UNC CFAR HIV Clinical Cohort who were screened for FI as part of HIV care between 2021 and 2022, we estimated unadjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) comparing the probability of reporting FI by demographic and clinical characteristics. The 479 PWH screened for FI were 65% cisgender men, 62% non-Hispanic Black PWH, a median of 54 years old (IQR 41-62), and 93% with an HIV viral load (VL) < 200 copies/mL. FI prevalence was 36.3% (95% CI 32.3%-40.9%). Cisgender women and transgender adults were more likely to report FI than cisgender men (PRs 1.24 [95% CI 0.97-1.59] and 2.03 [1.32-3.12], respectively). Compared with White PWH, the PR was 1.71 (1.20-2.42) for Black and 2.44 (1.56-3.82) for Hispanic PWH. The PR was 1.42 (0.98-2.05) for PWH with VL >/= 200 versus < 200 copies/mL. Having no or public versus private health insurance was also associated with FI. PWH with FI had a high prevalence of comorbidities including hypercholesterolemia (49%) and hypertension (48%), though these were not associated with FI. Almost half of PWH with FI were not accessing a food pantry or nutrition assistance program. Identifying FI in PWH is critical as FI is common and may contribute to viral non-suppression, poor comorbidity control, and gender and racial/ethnic health disparities in PWH.",,pubmed

This study aimed to explore the spatiotemporal transmission patterns and socioeconomic factors of PTB in Dongguan city, China. METHODS/DESIGN: An ecological study based on the reported new PTB cases between 2011 and 2020 was conducted in Dongguan city, China. The spatiotemporal analysis methods were used to explore the long-term trend, spatiotemporal transmission pattern and socioeconomic factors of PTB. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of new PTB cases. PARTICIPANTS: We collected 35 756 new PTB cases, including 23 572 males and 12 184 females. RESULTS: The seasonal-trend decomposition indicated a significant downward trend for PTB with a significant peak in 2017 and 2018, and local spatial autocorrelation showed more and more high-high clusters in the central and north-central towns with high incidence. The multivariate spatial time series analysis revealed that the endemic component had a leading role in driving PTB transmission, with a high total effect value being 189.40 (95% CI: 171.65-207.15). A Bayesian spatiotemporal model revealed that PTB incidence is positively associated with the agricultural population ratio (relative risk (RR) =1.074), gender ratio (RR=1.104) and the number of beds in medical institutions (RR=1.028). CONCLUSIONS: These findings revealed potential spatiotemporal variability and spatial aggregation of PTB, so targeted preventive strategies should be made in different towns based on spatiotemporal transmission patterns and risk factors.",,pubmed

METHODS: We used four survey rounds of data collected from July 2011 to May 2018 from non-migrant participants aged 15-49 years in the Rakai Community Cohort Study. Non-migrants were individuals with no-migration between surveys or at the prior survey. Household migration was defined as >/=1 household member migrating into or out of the house from another community between surveys ( approximately 18 months). Incident HIV was defined as testing HIV seropositive following a negative result. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated using Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations. Analyses were stratified by gender, migration into or out of the household and the relationship between non-migrants and migrants (e.g. spouse, child). RESULTS: About 11 318 non-migrants (5674 women) were followed for 37 320 person-years. Twenty-eight percent (6059/21 370) of non-migrant person-visits had recent migration into or out of the household, and 240 HIV incident cases were identified. Overall, non-migrants in migrant households were not at greater risk of acquiring HIV than non-migrants in households without any migration. However, men were significantly more likely to acquire HIV if their spouse had recently migrated in [adjusted IRR: 2.12; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05-4.27] or out (adjusted IRR: 4.01; 95% CI, 2.16-7.44) compared with men with no spousal migration. CONCLUSIONS: HIV incidence is higher among non-migrant men with migrant spouses. Targeted HIV testing and prevention interventions like pre-exposure prophylaxis could be considered for men with migrant spouses.",,pubmed

Variation in incidence rate of TB was analyzed using the joinpoint regression method. Spatial analyses techniques included the global and local Moran indices and Getis-Ord Gi* analysis. Demographic changes in new cases were analyzed descriptively, and the Geodetector method measured the influence of risk factors on student TB incidence. The analysis revealed a declining trend in TB cases, particularly among male students. TB incidence showed geographical heterogeneity, with lower rates in underdeveloped rural areas compared to urban regions. Significant spatial correlations were observed, with high-high clusters forming in central Jilin Province. Hotspots of student TB transmission were primarily concentrated in the southwestern and central regions from 2008 to 2018. Socio-economic factors exhibited nonlinear enhancement effects on incidence rates, with a dominant bifactor effect. High-risk zones were predominantly located in urban centers, with university and high school students showing higher incidences than other educational stages. The study revealed economic determinants as being especially important in affecting TB incidence among students, with these factors having nonlinear interacting effects on student TB incidence.",,pubmed

We assessed the geographical distribution of its risk in all climatic zones of the country based on the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) approach to climate risk analysis. This methodology considers three main driving components affecting the risk: Hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Considering the malaria impact chain, various variables were identified for each of the risk factors and for each variable, a measurable indicator was identified. These indicators were then standardized, weighted through a participatory approach based on expert judgement and finally aggregated to calculate current and future risk. With regard to the four climatic zones in the country: Attieen (sub-equatorial regime) in the South, Baouleen (humid tropical) in the centre, Sudanese or equatorial (tropical transition regime) in the North and the mountainous (humid) in the West. Malaria risk among pregnant women and children under 5 was found to be higher in the mountainous and the Baouleen climate, with the hazard highest in the mountainous climate and Exposure very high in the Attieen climate. The most vulnerable districts were those in Baouleen, Attieen and the mountainous climates. By 2050, the IPCC representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios predict an increase in risk in almost all climatic zones, compared to current levels, with the former considering a moderate scenario, with an emissions peak around 2040 followed by a decline and RCP 8.5 giving the highest baseline emissions scenario, in which emissions continue to rise. It is expected that the AR5 approach to climate risk analysis will be increasingly used in climate risk assessment studies so that it can be better assessed at a variety of scales.",,pubmed

However, epidemiological studies investigating changes in LC and their impact on TB are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of LC on TB mortality in Brazil. DESIGN AND SETTING: This ecological study, using panel data on spatial and temporal aggregates, was conducted in 1,614 municipalities between 2002 and 2015. METHODS: Data were collected from the Mortality Information System and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. The proxy variable used for LC was the Urban Health Index (UHI). Negative binomial regression models were used to estimate the effect of the UHI on TB mortality rate. Attributable risk (AR) was used as an impact measure. RESULTS: From 2002 to 2015, TB mortality rate decreased by 23.5%, and LC improved. The continuous model analysis resulted in an RR = 0.89 (95%CI = 0.82-0.96), so the AR was -12.3%. The categorized model showed an effect of 0.92 (95%CI = 0.83-0.95) in municipalities with intermediate LC and of 0.83 (95%CI = 0.82-0.91) in those with low LC, representing an AR for TB mortality of -8.7% and -20.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Improved LC impacted TB mortality, even when adjusted for other determinants. This impact was greater in the strata of low-LC municipalities.",,pubmed

The objective of this study was to compare infectious disease risks within the same occupations by gender. A systematic review of peer-reviewed studies published between 2016 and 2021 was undertaken. To be included, studies were required to report infectious disease risks for men, women or non-binary people within the same occupation. The included studies were appraised for methodological quality. A post hoc power calculation was also conducted. 63 studies were included in the systematic review. Among high-quality studies with statistical power (9/63), there was evidence of a higher hepatitis risk for men than for women among patient-facing healthcare workers (HCWs) and a higher parasitic infection risk for men than for women among farmers (one study each). The rest of the high-quality studies (7/63) reported no difference between men and women, including for COVID-19 risk among patient-facing HCWs and physicians, hepatitis risk among swine workers, influenza risk among poultry workers, tuberculosis risk among livestock workers and toxoplasmosis risk among abattoir workers. The findings suggest that occupational infectious disease risks are similarly experienced for men and women within the same occupation with a few exceptions showing a higher risk for men. Future studies examining gender/sex differences in occupational infectious diseases need to ensure adequate sampling by gender.",,pubmed

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study with the recruitment of TGW through respondent-driven sampling (TransOdara Study). The investigated outcome variable was prior testing for HIV, syphilis, HBV, and HCV in the last 12 months. The association between sociodemographic and behavioral factors with the outcome was analyzed using a binomial logistic regression with mixed effects. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI95%) were estimated. RESULTS: The proportions of individuals with prior testing in the past year were as follows: 56.3% for HIV, 58.0% for syphilis, 42.1% for HBV, and 44.7% for HCV. Negative associations with prior testing were observed for individuals aged 35 years or older, whereas positive associations were found for those with high school education, those who experienced verbal or psychological violence in the last 12 months, and those who had commercial or casual partners in the last 6 months. CONCLUSION: There was low frequency of testing in the 12 months preceding the study for HIV, syphilis, HBV, and HCV compared to the guidelines established by the Ministry of Health. Expanding access to and engagement with healthcare and prevention services for TGW is an essential strategy in reducing the transmission chain of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).",,pubmed

METHODS: TransOdara was a cross-sectional study on sexually transmitted infections among transgender women and travestis in five Brazilian cities between 2019 and 2021. Self-identified transgender women and travestis aged >/=18 years were recruited using respondent-driven sampling, completed an interviewer-led questionnaire, and provided samples to detect HIV. The outcome was the result of the rapid antigen testing for HIV. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were obtained using Poisson regression with robust variance. RESULTS: Overall, this population was found to be especially vulnerable, with high levels of unstable housing and engagement in informal work. They usually resort to transactional sex as their main working activity. Half of them earned less than the Brazilian minimum wage, which characterizes a poor population living in dire conditions. The overall HIV prevalence was 34.40%. In the final model, the variables associated with the HIV prevalence were as follows: to be 31 years old or older, not studying at the moment they were interviewed, to be unemployed, and engaged in lifetime transactional sex. CONCLUSION: We found disproportionately high HIV prevalence among transgender women and travestis, compared with a low prevalence among respective segments of Brazil's general population, which highlights the context of vulnerability in this population. The data point to the urgency for intensification and expansion of access to HIV prevention and strategies to stop discrimination in health care (among other services and contexts) and provide comprehensive services for this population.",,pubmed
A119,Prevalence and factors associated with anemia among HIV-infected women in sub-saharan Africa: a multilevel analysis of 18 countries.,10.1186/s12889-024-19758-2,Tilahun WM; Gebreegziabher ZA; Geremew H; Simegn MB,2024.0,BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: Despite the intended 50% reduction in anemia in women of reproductive age, this tendency has only worsened. Even though iron deficiency is the most prevalent cause of anemia, anemia and chronic illnesses like HIV are closely associated; in fact, 48.6% of people living with HIV who were 15 years of age or older had anemia. However, the burden of anemia among HIV-positive women in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries is not well documented. Therefore, the goal of our research was to investigate anemia and the factors that are linked to it in SSA women who had HIV infections. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using demographic and health survey datasets from 18 SSA countries. A total of 7823 weighted samples were included. STATA version 16 software was used for analysis. A multilevel logistic regression model was fitted. An adjusted odds ratio with a 95% CI and a p-value < 0.05 was used to declare significantly associated factors. RESULT: The overall prevalence of anemia was found to be 45.1% [95% CI: 43.97-46.18%]. Of those 5.05%, 37.97%, and 56.97% were severely, moderately, and mildly anemic, respectively. Education level of primary [AOR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.89], secondary [AOR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.98], and higher [AOR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.99], as well as current contraceptive use [AOR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.63, 0.87] were negatively associated with anemia. While pregnancy [AOR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.17, 1.94], breast feeding [AOR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.17, 1.64], health insurance [AOR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.25, 1.80], and menstruation within six weeks prior to data collection [AOR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.20, 1.54] had a significant positive relation with anemia among HIV-infected women in SSA countries. CONCLUSION: Anemia is a serious public health problem among HIV-infected women in SSA countries. Pregnancy, breast feeding, health insurance, and menstruation within six weeks prior to data collection were significant risk factors. On the other education and current contraceptive use were significant protective factors for anemia among HIV-infected women in SSA countries. Therefore, strategies aimed at early identification of anemia may lead to an improvement in the health of HIV-infected women.",,pubmed

It spreads through fingers, flies, and fomites, especially in situations where there is overcrowding. If untreated, the illness may result in blindness. Trachoma is an ancient disease and has previously been a significant public health problem in many areas of the world, including parts of Europe and North America. There are at least 400 million cases of active trachoma in the world, 8 million of which have resulted in blindness. Trachoma is a serious public health issue that is very common in Ethiopia. Therefore, the objective of this study is to identify the determinants of active trachoma among rural children aged 1-9 years old in Aw-bare woreda, Somali region of Ethiopia. METHOD: A cross-sectional community-based study involving children aged 1-9 who lived in six selected rural kebeles in the Awbare woreda Somali region and carried out using an ordinal logistic regression model. The study comprised 377 children in total. Our sample youngsters were chosen through a two-stage cluster sampling procedure. Then also chose our sample kebeles by simple random sampling. The main environmental, personal, and demographic factors that influenced the outcomes of active trachoma status were modeled using partial proportional odds modeling and descriptive statistics. RESULT: The study showed that the prevalence of active trachoma was found to be 47.7%. The covariate secondary level of education of mother OR = 1.357; 95% CI (1.051, 1.75), P-value = 0.0192, Inside house cooking place of children family OR = 0.789:95% CI (0.687, 0.927), P-value = 0.0031, children stay at home OR = 2.203:95%CI (1.526, 3.473), P-value = 0.0057,rich income family OR = 1.335:95%CI(1.166,1.528),P-value = 0.0001,Amount of water fetched per day OR = 2.129,95%CI(1.780,2.547),P-Vaue = 0.0001 were significant effect on active trachoma. PPOM represents the best fit as it has the smallest AIC and BIC. It is also more parsimonious. CONCLUSION: The mother's educational level, the location where the children spent the majority of their time indoors cooking, the fly density during the interview, the family's income, the child's age in years, the distance to the water source, the quantity of water fetched daily, and the number of people sharing a room have all been found to be significant predictors of the child's active trachoma status. Thus, increasing maternal education, access to clean water, and socioeconomic position are all crucial measures in preventing trachoma. Preventing trachoma also involves reducing the number of kids in a room and enhancing activities linked to personal cleanliness, such as giving kids a thorough facial wash to remove debris and discharge from their eyes.",,pubmed

Previous studies have shown that helminths can affect the shedding of bacteria or the bacterial load in the sputum of active TB patients. However, there is limited information on bacterial load in TB patients with helminth infections. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare bacterial load in helminths-infected and non-infected pulmonary tuberculosis patients at selected public health facilities in Jimma zone, Oromia, Ethiopia. METHODS: The study was conducted in Jimma Zone, Oromia, Ethiopia. A facility-based comparative cross-sectional study was employed from August 01, 2020, to January 2021. A total of 124 (55 intestinal helminths-infected and 69 non-infected) newly diagnosed smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients were included in the study. A convenience sampling technique was employed to recruit study participants, and a semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data regarding socio-demographic characteristics and possible risk factors for intestinal helminths co-infection. Stool examination was performed using both wet mount and Kato Katz technique. Additionally, weight and height measurements, sputum, and blood samples were taken to determine body mass index, bacilli load, and diabetic mellitus, respectively. Data were entered into Epi-Data software version 3.1 and analyzed using Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 25. A statistically significant difference was defined as a P-value of less than 0.05. RESULTS: Intestinal helminths reduced bacilli load 3 times more than intestinal helminths non-infected PTB (AOR = 3.44; 95% CI; 1.52, 7.79; P = 0.003) However, diabetes mellitus, HIV, drinking alcohol and cigarette smoking were not associated with bacilli load. The rate of co-infection TB with intestinal helminths was 44%. The three most prevalent parasites detected were Trichuris trichiura 29 (66%), hookworm 19 (43%), and Ascaris lumbricoides 11(25%)). Among co-infected patients about 36 (81.8%) had a single parasite infection, and 19 (43.2%) had multiple infections. A body mass index < 18.5 (AOR = 3.26; 95% CI; 1.25, 8.56;P = 0.016) and untrimmed fingernail status (AOR = 3.63; 95%CI;1.32,9.93;P = 0.012) were significantly associated with PTB- intestinal helminth -co-infection. CONCLUSION: Helminth infection was associated with a lower bacilli load compared to helmenths non-infected PTB. The rate of co-infection TB with intestinal helminths was 44%. Trichuris trichiura was the most prevalent helminth. Untrimmed fingernail and a body mass index were associated with PTB-intestinal helminth co-infection.",,pubmed

METHODS: 29,667 tuberculosis flow data were derived from the new smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis cases in China. Spatial variation of TB transmission was measured by geodetector q-statistic and spatial interaction model was used to model the tuberculosis flow and the regional socioeconomic factors. RESULTS: Tuberculosis transmission flow presented spatial heterogeneity. The Pearl River Delta in southern China and the Yangtze River Delta along China's east coast presented as the largest destination and concentration areas of tuberculosis inflows. Socioeconomic factors were determinants of tuberculosis flow. Some impact factors showed different spatial associations with tuberculosis transmission flow. A 10% increase in per capita GDP was associated with 10.2% in 2010 or 2.1% in 2012 decrease in tuberculosis outflows from the provinces of origin, and 1.2% in 2010 or 0.5% increase in tuberculosis inflows to the destinations and 18.9% increase in intraprovincial flow in 2012. Per capita net income of rural households and per capita disposable income of urban households were positively associated with tuberculosis flows. A 10% increase in per capita net income corresponded to 14.0% in 2010 or 3.6% in 2012 increase in outflows from the origin, 44.2% in 2010 or 12.8% increase in inflows to the destinations and 47.9% increase in intraprovincial flows in 2012. Tuberculosis incidence had positive impacts on tuberculosis flows. A 10% increase in the number of tuberculosis cases corresponded to 2.2% in 2010 or 1.1% in 2012 increase in tuberculosis inflows to the destinations, 5.2% in 2010 or 2.0% in 2012 increase in outflows from the origins, 11.5% in 2010 or 2.2% in 2012 increase in intraprovincial flows. CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis flows had clear spatial stratified heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation, regional socio-economic characteristics had diverse and statistically significant effects on tuberculosis flows in the origin and destination, and income factor played an important role among the determinants.",,pubmed

The Northern region of the country recorded the highest malaria case fatality rate (CFR) for two consecutive years: 1.11% in 2013 and 1.07% in 2014. Even though the National Malaria Elimination Programme (NMEP) has achieved a reduction in malaria mortality, the existence of high case fatality in the Northern region was alarming. This study, therefore, aimed to determine the factors associated with malaria mortality in the northern region of Ghana to institute control measures. METHODS: An unmatched case control study was conducted from July 2015 to August 2015. The study population consisted of patients admitted to health facilities for severe malaria in the Northern region of Ghana. A case was defined as a patient diagnosed with severe malaria at an eligible health facility who died as a result of malaria. A control was a patient diagnosed with severe malaria admitted to an eligible health facility who did not die. Health facilities that recorded CFRs of 1.0% and above were randomly sampled for this study, after which, 10 cases and 20 controls were recruited from each health facility. Information on cases and controls was then abstracted from hospital records using an electronically deployed abstraction tool. Continuous variables were expressed as means and medians, and categorical variables as frequencies and proportions. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the strength of the association between malaria mortality and factors predictive of malaria mortality. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In all, a total of 95 cases and 190 controls participated in this study. The median ages of cases and controls were 4.1 years (IQR = 21.6) and 5.7 years (IQR = 18.2), respectively. Fifty-four (56.8%) cases were females, while 93 (49.0%) of the controls were females. Factors associated with malaria mortality included: duration of hospital stay less than 24 h [aOR: 12.0, 95% CI (5.9-24.6)], severe pallor [aOR: 2.3, 95% CI (1.1-4.6)], children under 5 years [aOR: 2.8, 95% CI (1.4-5.6)], oral Artesunate/Amodiaquine administration [aOR: 0.4, 95% CI (0.2-0.9)] and sepsis as an additional diagnosis [aOR: 4.1, 95% CI (1.8-9.5)]. CONCLUSION: Predictors of malaria mortality in the Northern region include children under 5 years, severe pallor, sepsis as an additional diagnosis, and use of oral anti-malarial. Patients with severe pallor and sepsis as co-morbidities should receive proactive management. The NMEP and its partners should implement measures to strengthen the referral system, anaemia prevention and management, and retrain health workers on malaria case management. Malaria control interventions targeted at under five children in the region should be reviewed and enhanced.",,pubmed

Dengue outbreaks in Guatemala have been occurring more often and at increased rates since the first dengue outbreak in Guatemala in the 1970s. This study will examine environmental and socioeconomic factors associated with dengue in Guatemala at the municipality (county) level. Socioeconomic factors included population density, Mayan population, economic activity, and attending school. Environmental factors included average minimum annual temperature and annual precipitation. The relationship between environmental and socioeconomic variables and dengue fever incidence was initially evaluated through univariate zero-inflated negative binomial models, and then again through three zero-inflated multivariate negative binomial regression models. For all three models, elevation was considered a predictor of zero-inflation. In the combined model, there was a positive relationship between minimum temperature, economic activity and dengue fever incidence, and a negative relationship between population density, Mayan population and dengue fever. Predicted rates of dengue fever incidence and adjusted confidence intervals were calculated after increasing minimum yearly temperature by 1 degrees C and 2 degrees C. The three municipalities with the highest minimum yearly temperature (El Estor, Iztapa, and Panzos) and the municipality of Guatemala, all had an increase in the magnitude of the risk of dengue fever incidence following 1 degrees C and 2 degrees C increase in temperature. This research suggests that these socioeconomic and environmental factors are associated with risk of dengue in Guatemala. The predicted rates of dengue fever also highlight the potential effect that climate change in the form of increasing temperature can have on dengue in Guatemala.",,pubmed

METHODOLOGY: In this ecological and exploratory study, the microregions were used as spatial units because they are formed by contiguous municipalities with similar characteristics. The epidemiological, environmental, socioeconomic, and public health policy data employed were obtained from the official information systems at the Ministry of Health, National Institute for Space Research, and Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. A fuzzy system was developed to identify risk factors for the disease, using Python programming language. The results were analyzed with the bivariate Global Moran spatial analysis technique. RESULTS: It was observed that the Altamira microregion had the highest risk percentage for the disease, while Breves had the lowest, with significant differences in the relevance of its conditioning factors, mainly related to land use and cover patterns, in addition to demography and living conditions index, education and public health policies. CONCLUSIONS: The fuzzy system associated with the geostatistical technique was satisfactory for identifying areas with health vulnerability gradients related to deforestation, pasture, poverty, illiteracy, and health services coverage, as its conditioning variables. Thus, it was demonstrated that deforestation was the main risk factor for the disease. The system can also be used in environmental and epidemiological surveillance.",,pubmed

Among 347 households, 54 households had reported dengue cases, and 69 individuals had reported dengue cases in last one year. Garbage and water collection site and methods, drainage and household type, household monthly income, indoor bamboo plants, construction site (within 500 m), presence of tertiary care hospital, were the significant predictors of dengue incidences in Delhi. In conclusion, strategic control measures and intense social interventions such as household and community awareness, promotion of healthy practices should be promoted to control the dengue incidences.",,pubmed

People with HIV (PWH) are at risk for chronic liver diseases. We evaluated the association between low SES and hepatic outcomes in PWH. METHODS: We included PWH from a prospective cohort. SES was assessed by the Pampalon material and social deprivation index to classify the cohort into quintiles of deprivation. Multivariable linear regression was used to investigate associations of material and social deprivation with liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) as markers of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis, respectively. Incidence of outcomes was evaluated through survival analysis. RESULTS: Among the 804 PWH included, 45% and 72% were living in areas of the highest material and social deprivation, respectively. Materially deprived PWH were more frequently female and of non-white ethnicity and had higher prevalence of metabolic comorbidities. After adjustments, material deprivation correlated with increased LSM (beta = 1.86, 95% CI 0.53-3.17) but not with CAP (beta = 6.47, 95% CI -5.55-18.49). Patients were observed for a median follow-up of 3.8 years. Incidence of liver-related events was higher in most materially deprived compared to most privileged PWH (hazard ratio 3.03, 95% CI 1.03-8.92), while there was no difference in extrahepatic outcomes or all-cause mortality. Social deprivation showed no association with either LSM or clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Living in materially deprived neighbourhoods as a proxy for lower SES, is associated with LSM and liver-related events in PWH. Future strategies should explore mechanisms underlying these relationships and whether enhanced material security improves hepatic outcomes.",,pubmed

The study aimed to assess the distribution of active trachoma and its associated risk factors among children 1-9 years aged in Households of Sasiga Rural District, Western Ethiopia, in 2022. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 577 randomly selected children from March to May 2022. A multistage sampling technique was used. Data was collected through an interviewer-based questionnaire, physical observation, and clinical eye examinations. Epi Data 3.1 was used for data entry. The data were analyzed with SPSS version 24. Bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regressions were performed. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, the adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used to identify factors associated with active trachoma. A P-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The distribution of Active Trachoma among children 1-9 years aged in Households of the study area was 9.5%(95%CI:7.11,11.89). Being from a low-income household with a monthly income of less than 1500 ETB [AOR = 3.49, 95% CI: 1.39, 8.75], Households where the nearest water supply is more than 30 min away [AOR = 8.34, 95%CI: 1.89, 36.73], households with only one room [AOR = 2.98, 95%CI: 1.027, 8.68], and presence of feces in the compound of the households [AOR = 3.08, 95%CI: 1.41, 6.75] were associated with active trachoma in 1-9 years aged children living in the study setting. CONCLUSION: The distribution of Active Trachoma among children 1-9 years aged in Households of the study area was found to be high. Monthly income, the time it took to get water for home use, and the presence of feces in household compounds were all linked to active trachoma in children living in the study area. As a result, continuous sanitary education on trachoma transmission and prevention should be strengthened in the district.",,pubmed

Our aim was to assess the seroprevalence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific antibodies and associated factors among PLWH in Sierra Leone. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of PLWH aged 18 years or older in Sierra Leone between August 2022 and January 2023. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody (immunoglobulin M/immunoglobulin G [IgG]) kits. Stepwise logistic regression was used to explore factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence with a significance level of p < .05. RESULTS: In our study, 33.4% (1031/3085) participants had received a COVID-19 vaccine, and 75.7% were SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive. Higher IgG seroprevalence was observed in females (77.2% vs. 71.4%, p = .001), adults over 60 years (88.2%), those with suppressed HIV RNA (80.7% vs. 51.7%, p < .001), antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced individuals (77.9% vs. 44.6%, p < .001), and vaccinated participants (80.7% vs. 73.2%, p < .001). Patients 60 years or older had the highest odds of IgG seroprevalence (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.73, 95% CI = 1.68-4.65).

Few studies have investigated the impact of COVID-19 infection on health and socioeconomic factors or COVID-19 stigma. We sought to measure the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection among a cohort of PWHs, characterize associated risk factors and impact, and document perceptions of COVID-19-related stigma. METHODS: Data for this cross-sectional study come from the COVID-19 survey of participants in the DC Cohort longitudinal study from October 30, 2020, through December 31, 2022. Survey results were linked to electronic health records, including HIV laboratory test results and COVID test results. We conducted analyses comparing demographic, socioeconomic, HIV measures, and stigma among those with and without self-reported COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 1972 survey respondents, 17% self-reported COVID-19 infection, with the greatest incidence in the Omicron wave of the pandemic. We found statistically significant differences by age, employment status, essential worker status, education, and household income. Longer duration of HIV diagnosis was associated with greater incidence of COVID-19. PWHs who were overweight or obese had a greater incidence of COVID-19 compared with those who were not. Over 40% of PWHs with COVID-19 reported experiencing at least 1 form of COVID-19-related stigma. CONCLUSION: We observed a high incidence of COVID-19 infection among PWHs in DC. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of PWHs with COVID-19 reported experiencing COVID-19-related stigma. These findings add to the existing literature on COVID-19 coinfection among PWHs and highlight the need for awareness and support for those experiencing COVID-19 stigma.",,pubmed

Activity space represents a modifiable risk or protective factor for behavior related to health status and quality of life, in both clinical and nonclinical populations. We conducted an observational study with 286 participants (243 HIV+ and 43 HIV-), roughly matched for socioeconomic status and neighborhood of residence via three waves of snowball sampling. Each participant carried a smartphone for up to 4 weeks, making 5 randomly prompted entries and 1 end-of-day entry each day, plus self-initiated event-contingent entries for sexual activity and drug use. Responses to randomly prompted items provided subjective evaluations of the safety of the participant's current social and physical environment (the place they were and the people they were with). GPS-based location tracking-coupled with publicly available statistic indicating neighborhood-level physical disorder and socioeconomic disadvantage-provided an indicator of each participant's exposure to objective psychosocial hazard. We examined possible relationships of these objective and subjective environmental exposures with risky sexual and intravenous drug-use behavior, knowledge and utilization of antiretroviral treatment and prophylaxis, and momentary mental health (mood and stress, which relate to risky behavior and overall well-being). We found that both risky behavior and mental health were more related to participants' subjective evaluations of their activity space than to objective measures of neighborhood-level disorder, suggesting that, even within an objectively hazardous neighborhood, people who find a niche they perceive as socially and physically safe may engage in less risky behavior and have better well-being.Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier NCT01571752.",,pubmed

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to find out the factors associated with the high burden of MB leprosy in West Bengal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This case-control study was conducted from August 2020 to December 2022 in three high-endemic districts (annual new case detection rate >/=10/lakh) of West Bengal. OBJECTIVES: MB cases registered under the National Leprosy Eradication Programme were considered as case and paucibacillary (PB) cases were considered as control. Weighted sample sizes for cases and controls in each of the three districts were selected using simple random sampling from the list of registered leprosy patients. Requisite data were collected through structured interview with a validated questionnaire in Bengali. R, version 4.1.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2021, Vienna, Austria) was used for data analysis. A binary logistic regression model was prepared with the type of leprosy as a dependent variable. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety-eight individuals, 204 MB and 194 PB, participated in this study with 1.97% nonresponse rate. Gender, marital status, and diagnostic delay (adjusted odds ratio = 2.75 [1.66,4.65]) were associated with developing MB. Not perceiving the symptoms seriously (90, 56% [PB], 97, 51% [MB]), lack of knowledge about the disease and its complications (47, 29% [PB], 53, 28% [MB]), delayed referral by the private practitioners (11, 7% [PB], 22, 12% [MB]) were the major reasons of delay. CONCLUSION: This study identified a vulnerable group - married and migrated males. Changing from annual screening to quarterly screening along with capacity building and awareness generation of the targeted population is the need of the hour for eradicating the disease.",,pubmed

The study of multimorbidity of anaemia, malaria, and malnutrition (MAMM) among children in Nigeria has not received significant attention. This study aims to investigate what risk factors are associated with the prevalence of multimorbidity among children aged 6 to 59 months in Nigeria. This study used two nationally representative cross-sectional surveys, the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey and the 2018 National Human Development Report. A series of multilevel mixed-effect ordered logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations between child/parent/household variables (at level 1), community-related variables (at level 2) and area-related variables (at level 3), and the multimorbidity outcome (no disease, one disease only, two or more diseases). The results show that 48.3% (4917/10,184) of the sample of children aged 6-59 months display two or more of the disease outcomes. Being a female child, the maternal parent having completed higher education, the mother being anaemic, the household wealth quintile being in the richest category, the proportion of community wealth status being high, the region being in the south, and place of residence being rural were among the significant predictors of MAMM (p < 0.05). The prevalence of MAMM found in this study is unacceptably high. If suitable actions are not urgently taken, Nigeria's ability to actualise SDG-3 will be in grave danger. Therefore, suitable policies are necessary to pave the way for the creation/development of integrated care models to ameliorate this problem.",,pubmed

This study explored the coping strategies employed by workers at social venues. We interviewed 47 workers at 22 social venues through small group discussions (15) and in-depth interviews (10) in 2021 in Rakai district, Uganda. All discussions were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim before analysis. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis. We found two main categories of coping strategies used by workers: acceptance of sexual risks and keeping safe. Acceptance of risks such as transactional sex was the most used strategy, hence highlighting negative coping.

Despite global efforts to control the disease, its prevalence in high-risk African countries continues to be alarming, with records of substantial morbidity and mortality rates. Understanding the association of multiple childhood, maternal, and household factors with malaria prevalence, especially among vulnerable young populations, is crucial for effective intervention strategies. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the prevalence of malaria among UN5 children in selected high-risk SSA countries and analyzes its association with various childhood, maternal, and household factors. METHODS: Data from the Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS) spanning from 2010 to 2023 were analyzed. A weighted sample of 35,624 UN5 children from seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) known for high malaria prevalence was considered in the analyses. Descriptive statistics and modified Poisson regression analysis were used to assess the association of multiple factors with malaria prevalence. Stata version 15 software was used in analyzing the data and statistical significance was set at a 5% significance level. RESULTS: The overall pooled prevalence of malaria among the studied population was 26.2%, with substantial country-specific variations observed. In terms of child factors, a child's age was significantly associated with malaria prevalence (APR = 1.010, 95% CI: 1.007-1.012). Children of mothers with higher education levels (APR for higher education = 0.586, 95% CI: 0.425-0.806) and Fansidar uptake during pregnancy (APR = 0.731, 95% CI: 0.666-0.802) were associated with lower malaria risk. Children from middle-wealth (APR = 0.783, 95% CI: 0.706-0.869) and rich (APR = 0.499, 95% CI: 0.426-0.584) households had considerably lower malaria prevalence compared to those from poor households. Additionally, rural residency was associated with a higher risk of malaria compared to urban residency (APR = 1.545, 95% CI: 1.255-1.903). CONCLUSION: The study highlights a notable malaria prevalence among under-five (UN5) children in high-risk SSA countries, influenced significantly by factors such as maternal education, Fansidar uptake during pregnancy, socioeconomic status, and residency. These findings underscore the importance of targeted malaria prevention strategies that address these key determinants to effectively reduce the malaria burden in this vulnerable population.",,pubmed

Early sexual debut is one of the many factors linked to HIV infection that is discussed in the context of general public health. Monitoring this behavior is essential for developing preventative, evidence-based interventions. This study aims to describe the early and/or typical sexual debut among young people in Eswatini and examines sociodemographic and HIV risk factors associated with early and typical sexual debut timing. We analyzed cross-sectional secondary data from the 2016/17 Swaziland HIV Incidence Measurement Survey (SHIMS), which had a representative sample of 2,383 young people aged 18-24. Respondents were selected using a two-stage stratified probability sampling design. We applied descriptive statistics and multivariable multinomial logistic regressions to examine the data. Out of the 2,383 respondents, 71.3% had sexual experience, with 4.1% and 26.5% reporting early sexual debut (<15 years) and typical sexual debut (<18 years), respectively. Our study found that age, sex, education, marital status, wealth, sexual partners in the past 12 months, and alcohol use were significantly associated with early and/or typical sexual debut. It is crucial to consider the sociodemographic factors and HIV risk factors of young people when designing programs and interventions aimed at preventing early sexual debut or transition. This approach is necessary to promote better sexual and reproductive health in alignment with sustainable development goals.",,pubmed

Parallel to this decline, the country experienced improved living conditions, as illustrated by decreased infant mortality and increased life expectancy and wealth. In 1978, Denmark became a low-incidence country for TB with risk groups predominantly affected, and with a continuous change in demographics towards fewer Danish-born cases and relatively more migrant cases.ConclusionsThe decline over time in TB incidence and mortality in Denmark preceded specific TB interventions and can, first of all, be attributed to improved living conditions. TB has now become a rare disease in Denmark, predominantly occurring in particular risk groups. Future elimination of TB will require a combination of specific health interventions in these risk groups combined with a continued focus on improving socioeconomic status and living conditions.",,pubmed

Sociodemographic characteristics, health data (CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts and viral load), and biological samples (cervical, anal, and oral) were collected from 86 HIV-positive women undergoing antiretroviral therapy. Data were classified according to the presence or absence of HPV-DNA, HPV-DNA presence at one or more anatomic sites, and level of oncogenic risk, considering low- and high-risk oncogenic HPV-DNA groups. The presence of HPV in the cervicovaginal site was 65.9%, 63.8% in anal canal, and 4.2% in oral mucosa. A viral load >/=75 HIV copies/mL was associated with the presence of HPV-DNA.

The study aimed to assess the dynamics of tuberculosis (TB) infection using Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) and determine risk factors associated with TB infection. METHODS: Definite TB patients were interviewed and their household contacts were screened for TB infection by IGRA during 12-month longitudinal investigation. RESULTS: We included in our analyses 184 household contacts of 92 index TB patients. 87 individuals (47.3%) in contact group progressed to TB infection, of whom 86 developed into IGRA positive within 24 weeks. Close contacts with a higher age and comorbidities are easier to exhibit TB infection. Analysis showed that risk factors for becoming IGRA-positive individuals included residence, older age, comorbidities, BCG scar and high bacterial load. Contacts with BCG scar had a lower IGRA-positive rate. CONCLUSION: IGRA conversion generally occurs within 24 weeks after exposure. The TB transmission happens since subclinical TB stage and the presence of BCG scar is an independent protective factor reducing risk of TB infection among close contacts. Repeated IGRA tests are sensible to conducted among close contacts at 24 weeks after exposure to identify the IGRA-positive individuals.",,pubmed

However, while recent evidence established a positive causal relationship between some of these programmes and food security there is little evidence on the extent to which these initiatives are associated with better educational and sexual and reproductive health outcomes among vulnerable adolescents in Lesotho. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The study uses cross-sectional, nationally representative data from the 2018 Lesotho Violence Against Children and Youth Survey. Our research examined the association between social protection receipt and educational and sexual and reproductive health outcomes among adolescents and young people (13-24 years) living in poverty. We employed multivariate logistic regression controlling for age, orphanhood, HIV status and sex. Social protection receipt was defined as household receipt of financial support from a governmental, non-governmental, or community-based program that provides income. Additionally, we fitted a marginal effects model by sex. Among the 3,506 adolescent females and males living in the two lowest poverty quintiles, receipt of social protection was associated with improvements in multiple adolescent outcomes: higher odds of consistent condom use (aOR 1.64, 95% CI 1.17-2.29), educational attainment (aOR 1.79, 95% CI 1.36-2.36), and school enrolment (aOR 2.19, 95% CI 1.44-3.34). Stratified analyses by sex showed that social protection receipt was also associated with reduced likelihood of child marriage among females (aOR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42-0.83) and higher odds of educational attainment and school enrolment among males (aOR 2.53, 95% CI 1.59-4.03 and aOR 3.11, 95% CI 1.56-6.19, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence that social protection programs are associated with improved educational, sexual and reproductive health and child marriage prevention outcomes among adolescents living in poverty. Implementing and expanding such social protection initiatives could prove instrumental in improving the well-being of vulnerable adolescents. CONTRIBUTIONS: Social protection programs have been increasing in sub-Saharan African countries, playing a pivotal role in poverty reduction, with Lesotho being no exception. Despite the optimistic outlook brought about by the implementation of the National Social Protection Strategy Lesotho I (2014-19) and II (2021-2031), the impact of these programs on some specific outcomes that concern the lives of the most vulnerable adolescents in Lesotho remains to some extent unexplored. Additionally, Lesotho grapples with high rates of HIV, adolescent pregnancy, child marriage and early school dropout, which can further contribute to poor long-term health and social outcomes among adolescents. In this study, we used data from the 2018 Lesotho Violence Against Children and Youth Survey (VACS) to examine the association between receiving social protection and multiple adolescent outcomes: educational, sexual and reproductive. The findings revealed that social protection programs, particularly the existing government-provided cash transfers, are significantly associated with multiple better outcomes among adolescents living in the poorest households in Lesotho. Such cash transfer schemes in Lesotho are associated with improved sexual and reproductive health outcomes for adolescent females, including reduced child marriage rates, and improved educational outcomes for males. These findings indicate that government-led social protection programmes are positively associated with favourable outcomes that can improve the quality of life for adolescents in resource-limited settings.",,pubmed
A144,Examining the paradox: increased malaria risk in children under 5 in female-headed households in Nigeria.,10.1186/s12936-024-04997-w,Xing SY; Zhang HT; Wang LM; Lu HZ; Peng ZY; Liu M; Li CX; Deng SQ,2024.0,Malaria journal,"BACKGROUND: Nigeria is facing a severe malaria crisis, accounting for a significant proportion of global cases and deaths of malaria. This study aimed to investigate the differences between female-headed households (FHHs) and male-headed households (MHHs) and their impact on malaria risk among children under five (U5) in Nigeria. METHODS: Data from the 2021 Nigeria Malaria Indicator Survey (NMIS) were used for this cross-sectional study. A representative sample of 10,988 households was analysed, with key variables subjected to frequency calculations, descriptive statistics, and bivariate analyses using t-tests and chi-square analyses to compare the differences between FHHs and MHHs. RESULTS: Among all participants, 92.1% (N = 10,126) reported residing in male-headed households, while 7.8% (N = 862) reported living in female-headed households. MHHs were significantly more likely to own insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) than FHHs (64.7% vs. 53.6%, P < 0.001). U5 children in MHHs had a greater likelihood of sleeping under a bed net the night before the survey than U5 children in FHHs (35.3% vs. 30.0%, P < 0.05). The prevalence of fever in the previous two weeks among U5 children was similar in MHHs and FHHs (35.4% vs. 31.4%), and the testing rates for malaria among U5 children who experienced febrile episodes were higher in MHHs than FHHs (22.4% vs. 15.4%, P < 0.05). Although not statistically significant, FHHs exhibited a higher percentage of U5 children testing positive for malaria compared to MHHs (87.8% vs. 78.9%). On the other hand, FHHs had higher education levels, overall wealth index scores, and a larger presence in urban areas compared to MHHs (P < 0.001). Moreover, FHHs reported higher adherence to malaria prevention awareness (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In Nigeria, FHHs enjoy relatively better socioeconomic conditions and stronger awareness of malaria prevention compared to their male-headed counterparts. Contrary to expectations, FHHs are at an increased risk of malaria in children under 5 years old. This phenomenon is associated with entrenched gender inequality and the challenges women face in accessing critical assets. As women in FHHs bear the responsibility of income generation while caring for their children, it is crucial to prioritize interventions that address malaria management in FHHs to reduce both malaria incidence and mortality rates.",,pubmed

We evaluated the relationships among the density of green vegetation around rural houses, sociodemographic characteristics, and domestic (re)infestation with T. infestans while accounting for their spatial dependence in the municipality of Pampa del Indio between 2007 and 2016. METHODS: The study comprised sociodemographic and ecological variables from 734 rural houses with no missing data. Green vegetation density surrounding houses was estimated by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We used a hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression composed of fixed effects and spatial random effects to estimate domestic infestation risk and quantile regressions to evaluate the association between surrounding NDVI and selected sociodemographic variables. RESULTS: Qom ethnicity and the number of poultry were negatively associated with surrounding NDVI, whereas overcrowding was positively associated with surrounding NDVI. Hierarchical Bayesian models identified that domestic infestation was positively associated with surrounding NDVI, suitable walls for triatomines, and overcrowding over both intervention periods. Preintervention domestic infestation also was positively associated with Qom ethnicity. Models with spatial random effects performed better than models without spatial effects. The former identified geographic areas with a domestic infestation risk not accounted for by fixed-effect variables. CONCLUSIONS: Domestic infestation with T. infestans was associated with the density of green vegetation surrounding rural houses and social vulnerability over a decade of sustained vector control interventions. High density of green vegetation surrounding rural houses was associated with households with more vulnerable social conditions. Evaluation of domestic infestation risk should simultaneously consider social, landscape and spatial effects to control for their mutual dependency. Hierarchical Bayesian models provided a proficient methodology to identify areas for targeted triatomine and disease surveillance and control.",,pubmed

In Mozambique, as of 2021, the HIV prevalence rate among the adult population stood at 12.5%, with an even more concerning rate of 15.4% among women of reproductive age. METHODS: a cross-sectional study was carried out with secondary data from the Survey on National Indicators of Vaccination, Malaria, and HIV/AIDS (IMASIDA 2015), where we included married women, both civil marriage and common law marriage of reproductive age 15-49 years. Statistical analyses, including chi-squared tests and logistic regression models, accounting for survey design, were employed to assess associations. RESULTS: the study findings showed that HIV prevalence was higher among married women aged 35-49 years (aOR=2.5; 95% CI: 1.3-4.6; p=0.005), those without formal education (aOR=7.7; 95% CI: 1.1-52.9; p=0.038) and those with primary education (aOR=9.8; 95% CI: 1.6-60.1; p=0.014), those who experienced domestic violence (aOR=1.8; 95% CI: 1.0-3.2; p=0.04), had an uncircumcised partner (aOR=1.9; 95% CI: 1.2-3.1; p=0.008), and had three or more lifetime sex partners (aOR=3.6; 95% CI: 2.9-7.3; p<0.001). Women who were in one lifelong union had a lower risk of HIV positivity (aOR=0.5; 96%CI: 0.3-0.8, p=0.005). CONCLUSION: the findings of this study highlight sociodemographic, behavioral, and violent factors associated with HIV prevalence among women. These findings underscore the importance of targeted interventions and education programs aimed at reducing HIV transmission among females and promoting safer sexual practices.",,pubmed

Therefore, the goal of this work was to identify variables related to the spread of infection by T. cruzi in humans living in rural areas, seeking predictor variables. A systematic review of the literature has been conducted, with a search in the Scopus platform, using the search string ""Chagas disease"" and ""rural"", resulting in 85 valid and analyzed scientific studies (1977 and 2022). Twenty-seven predictor variables have been acquired, and 19 of them have been grouped, such as: socioeconomic and educational, housing, environmental, sanitary, and cultural; and 8 variables related to T. cruzi seropositive individuals. The predictor variables yielded significant results (p-value < 0.05) in 59.5% of the cases (195/328), with a median of 66.7%. In other words, studies relating to 50% of the 27 variables showed significance equal to or greater than 66.7% of the time. The independent variables with the highest proportion of significant data (p-value < 0.05) were Education (87.6%), Intradomicile building (70%), Domestic animals (69.6%), and Triatomines (69.2%) in the households. Some variables reached 100%; however, few articles were found, indicating the need for further research, especially for Sanitation and Culture. It has been concluded that, in the several contexts found, the social vulnerability and lack of information led the individual to living in environments where inhabitability is inadequate, to perform limited work activity and develop habits and behaviors which impair them in an environmental insalubrity situation, favorable to the access of vectors and pathogens of anthropozoonoses such as CD.",,pubmed

Since the factors influencing different episodes of TB might be different, this study focused on the first episode of TB disease (first-episode TB). METHODS: All first episodes in previously linked and geocoded TB notification data from 2007 to 2015 in Cape Town, South Africa, were aggregated at the neighbourhood level and merged with the 2011 census data. We conducted an ecological study to assess the association between neighbourhood incidence of first-episode TB and neighbourhood factors (total TB burden [all episodes] in the previous year, socioeconomic index, mean household size, mean age, and percentage males) using a negative binomial regression. We also examined the presence of hotspots in neighbourhood TB incidence with the Global Moran's I statistic and assessed spatial dependency in the association between neighbourhood factors and TB incidence using a spatial lag model. RESULTS: The study included 684 neighbourhoods with a median first-episode TB incidence rate of 114 (IQR: 0-345) per 100,000 people. We found lower neighbourhood socioeconomic index (SEI), higher neighbourhood total TB burden, lower neighbourhood mean household size, and lower neighbourhood mean age were associated with increased neighbourhood first-episode TB incidence. Our findings revealed a hotspot of first-episode TB incidence in Cape Town and evidence of spatial dependency in the association between neighbourhood factors and TB incidence. CONCLUSION: Neighbourhood TB burden and SEI were associated with first-episode TB incidence, and there was spatial dependency in this association. Our findings can inform targeted interventions to reduce TB in high-risk neighbourhoods, thereby reducing health disparities and promoting health equity.",,pubmed

Sub-Saharan Africa particularly Ethiopia faces a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus. In low-income settings like Ethiopia, early mortality rates are elevated due to severe opportunistic infections and advanced disease at Anti-retroviral treatment initiation. Despite available treatments, delayed treatment initiation among Human Immunodeficiency Virus -infected individuals in Africa, including Ethiopia, leads to disease progression and increased mortality risk. This study aimed to identify the factors contributing to the death of HIV patients under treatment at second line regimen in public hospitals of North Wollo and Waghemira Zones. A retrospective cohort study with 474 patients was conducted in selected hospitals of North Wollo and Waghemira Zones. A parametric Weibull regression model was employed, and the adjusted hazard ratio served as the measure of association. Variables significantly affected the outcome of the study was determined at a p-value < 0.05, along with a 95% confidence interval for the variables. The patients were within the average age of 38.6(standard deviation +/- 12.5) years and majority (45.57%) had no formal education. The overall death incidence rate among second-line anti-retroviral treatment patients was 1.98 per 100-person years [95% CI 1.4-2.9%]. Poor adherence to antiretroviral treatment, male gender, and being underweight significantly increased the hazard of death. Conversely, increased anti-retroviral treatment duration had a significant and negative impact, reducing the hazard of death among patients. The study reveals a high incidence of death among second line anti-retroviral treatment users. Independent predictors include poor adherence, male gender, and underweight status, all significantly increasing the risk of death. On the positive side, the hazard of death decreases with longer anti-retroviral treatment duration. A critical concern and counseling should be given for better ART adherence, to change their nutritional status and for males.",,pubmed

This study aimed to scrutinise the prevalence, spatial distribution and socio-demographic and behavioural risk factors associated with cutaneous leishmaniasis in children aged <5-15  years in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. METHODS: A total of 1, 559 clinically confirmed records of children diagnosed with cutaneous leishmaniasis (January-December) from 2020 and 2022 were obtained from selected district hospitals. In addition, a risk factors-related questionnaire was administered to 1, 011 households (400 in 2020 and 611 in 2022) in nine districts during a household survey. RESULTS: The maximum number of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases was recorded in 2022 (n = 877, 56.25%) as compared to 2020 (n = 682, 43.75%). The hospital records showed a greater number of male patients in the 2022 cohort (n = 603, 68.76%). The highest number of cases were observed in children aged 5-9 years in 2022 (n = 282, 32.16%) and 2020 (n = 255, 37.39%). In 2020 and 2022, cutaneous leishmaniasis cases showed peak aggregation in March (n = 118, 17.3%) and January (n = 322, 36.72%). From a spatial analysis, the maximum number of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases was recorded at 59-1700 m elevation in various land-use/land-cover and climatic regions with quaternary alluvium rock formations. A multivariate logistic regression model analysis of risk factors from the households survey suggested that age group, socio-economic status, construction materials of the house, use of insect repellents, Afghan refugee camps in the village/district, knowledge and biting times of sand flies, frequent use of mosquito bed nets, presence of domestic animals in the house, knowledge of the transmission period and peak month of leishmaniasis infection increased the risk of acquiring cutaneous leishmaniasis (p  value < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our analysis demonstrated that cutaneous leishmaniasis in children is influenced by a variety of environmental, socio-demographic and behavioural risk factors in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The increase in recorded cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis in children in 2022 compared to 2020 suggests that the infection likely extended to new foci in the province.",,pubmed

The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence and identify the risk factors associated with mental health disorders among this population in Rwanda. This cross-sectional study enrolled people living with HIV from 12 HIV clinics across Rwanda using random sampling. Trained HIV nurses conducted the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview to estimate the prevalence of major depressive episode, post-traumatic stress disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Sociodemographic, psychosocial, and HIV-related data were also collected. Associated risk factors for being diagnosed with one of the mental health disorders were assessed using modified Poisson regression with robust error variance. Of 428 participants, 70 (16.4%) had at least one mental health disorder with major depressive episode being most prevalent (n = 60, 14.0%). Almost all participants were adherent to antiretroviral therapy (n = 424, 99.1%) and virally suppressed (n = 412, 96.9%). Of those diagnosed with a mental health disorder, only few were aware of (n = 4, 5.7%) or under treatment for this mental health disorder (n = 5, 7.2%). Mental health disorders were associated with experiences of HIV-related stigma and discrimination (aRR = 2.14, 95%CI 1.30-3.53, p = 0.003). The results demonstrate underdiagnosis and undertreatment of mental health disorders among Rwandan People Living with HIV. Using HIV nurses to diagnose mental health disorders could serve as a low-cost strategy for integrating mental health care with existing HIV services and could inspire the implementation in other low-resource settings.",,pubmed

Moreover, prevalence of malaria differs in different geographical settings and epidemiological data were inadequate to assure disease status in the study area. This study was aimed to determine the prevalence of malaria and associated risk factors in selected rural kebeles in South Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted between February to June 2019 in eight malaria-endemic kebeles situated in four zones in South Ethiopia. Mult-stage sampling techniques were employed to select the study zones, districts, kebeles and households. Blood sample were collected from 1674 participants in 345 households by finger prick and smears were examined by microscopy. Sociodemographic data as well as risk factors for Plasmodium infection were collected using questionnaires. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of malaria in the study localities was 4.5% (76/1674). The prevalence was varied among the study localities with high prevalence in Bashilo (14.6%; 33/226) followed by Mehal Korga (12.1%; 26/214). Plasmodium falciparum was the dominant parasite accounted for 65.8% (50/76), while Plasmodium vivax accounted 18.4% (14/76). Co-infection of P. falciparum and P. vivax was 15.8% (12/76). Among the three age groups prevalence was 7.8% (27/346) in age less than 5 years and 7.5% (40/531) in 5-14 years. The age groups > 14years were less likely infected with Plasmodium parasite (AOR = 0.14, 95% CI 0.02-0.82) than under five children. Non-febrile individuals 1638 (97.8%) were more likely to had Plasmodium infection (AOR = 28.4, 95% CI 011.4-70.6) than febrile 36 (2.2%). Individuals living proximity to mosquito breeding sites have higher Plasmodium infection (AOR = 6.17, 95% CI 2.66-14.3) than those at distant of breeding sites. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria remains a public health problem in the study localities. Thus, malaria prevention and control strategies targeting children, non-febrile cases and individuals living proximity to breeding sites are crucial to reduce malaria related morbidity and mortality.",,pubmed

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of undernutrition on treatment outcomes among patients with TB in northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from different hospitals in northwest Ethiopia, for the period from July 2017 to August 2023. A Cox proportional hazard model was performed to determine the effect of undernutrition on TB treatment outcomes, which were defined as a composite of death, treatment failure, or loss to follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 602 patients with TB were included in the analysis. Of these, 367 (60.9%) were male, and 344 (57.1%) were undernourished. Upon completion of the follow-up period, 65 (10.8%) adults with TB had unsuccessful treatment outcomes. After adjusting for potential confounders, patients with undernutrition had a two times higher risk of experiencing unsuccessful treatment outcomes compared to well-nourished patients (AHR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.2, 3.6). In addition, patients residing in rural areas (AHR: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.7, 5.4), having a history of prior TB treatment (AHR: 2.2, 95%CI: 1.1, 4.1), and the presence of diabetes comorbidity (AHR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.2) were at higher risk of unsuccessful treatment outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Undernutrition increases the risk of unsuccessful treatment outcomes in Ethiopia. This finding suggests that nutritional support during TB treatment can improve successful treatment outcomes in high TB burden and low-income countries such as Ethiopia.",,pubmed

METHOD: We used substance use (Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription Medication, and Other Substance Use [TAPS]) and depression (PHQ-9) data from computerized screening of adult PWH in primary care clinics in Northern California, combined with health record data on psychiatric diagnoses, HIV diagnosis, treatment, and control (HIV RNA, CD4), insurance, and neighborhood deprivation index (NDI) to examine factors associated with SI (PHQ-9 item 9 score > 0). Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for SI were obtained from logistic regression models. RESULTS: Among 2829 PWH screened (92 % male; 56 % white; mean (SD) age of 54 (13) years; 220 (8 %) reported SI. Compared with no problematic use, SI was higher among those reporting one (aOR = 1.65, 95 % CI = 1.17, 2.33), two (aOR = 2.23, 95 % CI = 1.42, 3.49), or >/= 3 substances (aOR = 4.49, 95 % CI = 2.41, 8.39).

SI was not associated with HIV-related measures or NDI. LIMITATIONS: SI was assessed with a single PHQ-9 item. Simultaneous SI and exposure data collection restricts the ability to establish substance use as a risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: HIV care providers should consider multiple substance use, stimulant use, depression or anxiety, and public insurance as risk factors for SI and provide interventions when needed.",,pubmed

The objective of this study was to identify determinants of TB disease development in general and in relation to BCG vaccination in children in central Ethiopia. METHODS: We employed a 1:1 age-matched case-control design to compare the characteristics of children who developed TB (cases) with those who did not (controls). Data were collected in healthcare facilities in Addis Ababa city, Adama, and Bishoftu towns between September 25, 2021, and June 24, 2022. Two hundred and fifty-six cases were drawn at random from a list of childhood TB patients entered into SPSS software, and 256 controls were selected sequentially at triage from the same healthcare facilities where the cases were treated. A bivariate conditional logistic regression analysis was performed first to select candidate variables with p-values less than or equal to 0.20 for the multivariable model. Finally, variables with a p-value less than 0.05 for a matched adjusted odds ratio (mORadj) were reported as independent determinants of TB disease development. RESULTS: The mean age of the cases was nine years, while that of the controls was 10 years. Males comprised 126 cases (49.2%) and 119 controls (46.5%), with the remainder being females. Ninety-nine (38.7%) of the cases were not BCG-vaccinated, compared to 58 (22.7%) of the controls. Household TB contact was experienced by 43 (16.8%) of the cases and 10 (3.9%) of the controls. Twenty-two (8.6%) of the cases and six (2.3%) of the controls were exposed to a cigarette smoker in their household. Twenty-two (8.6%) of the cases and three (1.2%) of the controls were positive for HIV. Children who were not vaccinated with BCG at birth or within two weeks of birth had more than twice the odds (mORadj = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.28-3.48) of developing TB compared to those who were. Children who ever lived with a TB-sick family member (mORadj = 4.28, 95% CI = 1.95-9.39), smoking family members (mORadj = 3.15, 95% CI = 1.07-9.27), and HIV-infected children (mORadj = 8.71, 95% CI = 1.96-38.66) also had higher odds of developing TB disease than their counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Being BCG-unvaccinated, having household TB contact, having a smoker in the household, and being HIV-infected were found to be independent determinants of TB disease development among children.",,pubmed

In multivariable logistic regression, lower level of education (adjusted OR (AOR)=2.94; 95% CI 1.29 to 6.82), unemployment (AOR=2.74; 95% CI 1.29 to 6.84) and comorbid medical illness (AOR=1.80; 95% CI 1.03 to 3.14) were significantly associated with neurocognitive disorder. CONCLUSION: HIV-associated neurocognitive problems affected over a third of the participants. According to the current study, comorbid medical conditions, unemployment and low educational attainment are associated with an increased risk of neurocognitive disorder. Therefore, early detection and treatment are essential.",,pubmed

METHODS: This ecological study, carried out from January 2016 to December 2020, included the 62 municipalities of the state of Amazonas. The incidence rate of ACL was determined in space and time. Using Multiple Linear Regression by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Spatial Autoregressive Regression (SAR) models, the relationship between incidence rates and Human Development Index (HDI) and deforestation was analyzed., The high- and low-risk clusters were identified by employing the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. RESULTS: A total of 7,499 cases of ACL were registered in all 62 municipalities in the state. Most cases were in male (n=5,924; 79.24%), with the greatest frequency in the population aged from 20 to 39 years (n=3,356; 44.7%). The incidence rate in the state of Amazonas was 7.34 cases per 100,000 inhabitants-year, with the municipalities of Rio Preto da Eva and Presidente Figueiredo showing the highest rates (1,377.5 and 817.5 cases per 100,000 population-year, respectively). The ACL cases were clustered into specific areas related to those municipalities with the highest incidence rates. The SAR model revealed a positive relationship between ACL and deforestation. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of ACL was evident in a variety of patterns in the state of Amazonas; the high incidence rates and persistence of this disease in this state were linked to deforestation. The temporal distribution showed variations in the incidence rates during each year. Our results can help optimize the measures needed to prevent and control this disease in the state.",,pubmed

The legacy of exposure to malaria is robust while controlling for lifetime socioeconomic and health conditions, fixed effects, and considering selection bias. Additionally, we include the US Colored Troops sample of black veterans to analyze racial differences in the effect of malaria exposure on lifespan. Exposure to malaria did not lead to a shorter lifespan among black veterans. Evidence suggests that genetic immunity to malaria in black veterans might contribute this heterogeneity.",,pubmed

In Rwanda, both diseases have remained public health challenge over the years in spite of the numerous intervention programs and policies put in place. This study aimed at understanding the geographical variations between the joint and specific risks of both diseases in the country while quantifying the effects of some socio-demographic and climatic factors. Using data extracted from Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey, a shared component model was conceived and inference was based on integrated nested Laplace approximation. The study findings revealed similar spatial patterns for the risk of malaria and the shared risks of both diseases, thus confirming the strong link between malaria and anaemia. The spatial patterns revealed that the risks for contracting both diseases are higher among children living in the districts of Rutsiro, Nyabihu, Rusizi, Ruhango, and Gisagara. The risks for both diseases are significantly associated with type of place of residence, sex of household head, ownership of bed net, wealth index and mother's educational attainment. Temperature and precipitation also have substantial association with both diseases. When developing malaria intervention programs and policies, it is important to take into account climatic and environmental variability in Rwanda. Also, potential intervention initiatives focusing on the lowest wealth index, children of uneducated mothers, and high risky regions need to be reinforced.",,pubmed

It is the major cause of morbidity and mortality among children in Nigeria. Though different environmental factors have been assessed to influence the distribution and transmission of malaria vectors, there is a shortage of information on how they may influence malaria transmission among under-fives in Nigeria. METHODS: This study was based on the secondary data analysis of the Nigeria Malaria Indicator Survey 2021. The study sample comprised 10,645 women (aged 15-49) who delivered a child in the 2 years preceding the survey. The study was restricted to under-fives. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the risk of malaria. RESULTS: There was a positive association between the risk of malaria and heard/seen malaria messages in the last 6 months (AOR 1.39, 95% CI 1.19-1.62), houses with walls built using rudimentary materials (AOR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.04-1.83), at least 6 children living in the house (AOR 1.22, 95% CI 1.00-1.49), children being 1 or 2 years old was associated with increased odds (AOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.50-2.34 and AOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.52-2.36), children from households with only treated nets (AOR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04-1.46) and those from the North West or South East regions (AOR 1.50, 95% CI 1.10-2.05 and AOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.01-2.16), respectively. All other predictors were not associated with the risk of malaria. CONCLUSION: The factors associated with the risk of malaria in this study included sleeping under treated mosquito nets, the age of the children, residing in the northwest and southeast regions, wall construction material, 6 children and above in the household and hearing/seen malaria messages in the last 6 months. Continuous health education and public health interventions, such as the provision of LLITNs, will reduce the risk of malaria and improve the health and well-being of children under 5 years of age.",,pubmed

We aimed to investigate the prevalence and correlates of ADU among ALHIV in Ugandan fishing communities, areas characterized by high HIV and poverty rates. AYLHIV aged 18-24, who knew they were HIV-positive, were selected from six HIV clinics. Substance use was determined through self-report in the last 12 months and urine tests for illicit substances. Utilizing a socioecological framework, the study structured variables into a hierarchical logistic regression analysis to understand the multi-layered factors influencing ADU. Self-reported past 12 months substance use was 42%, and 18.5% of participants had a positive urine test for one or more substances, with alcohol, benzodiazepines, and marijuana being the most commonly used. With the addition of individual-level socio-demographics, indicators of mental health functioning, interpersonal relationships, and community factors, the logistic regression analysis revealed greater exposure to adverse childhood experiences increased the odds of substance use (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.24; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.03-1.55). Additionally, exposure to alcohol advertisements at community events significantly raised the odds of substance use (OR = 3.55; 95% CI: 1.43-8.83). The results underscore the high prevalence among AYLHIV and emphasize the need for comprehensive interventions targeting individual (e.g., life skills education and mental health supports), interpersonal (e.g., peer support and family-based interventions), community (e.g., community engagement programs, restricted alcohol advertisements and illicit drug access), and policies (e.g., integrated care models and a national drug use strategy), to address ADU.",,pubmed

However, there is a paucity of empirical evidence of such associations in sub-Saharan Africa. This study investigates how the household cost of malaria in children under five in Ghana varies based on different levels of health literacy. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey involving 1270 caregivers of children under five was conducted. The survey included health literacy questionnaire and several pieces of sociodemographic and behavioural variables. RESULTS: We created seven caregiver health literacy profiles by scoring nine dimensions. The mean total cost for managing malaria among respondents was US$20.29 per episode. The total household cost for caregivers with high health literacy (Profile 1) (US$24.77) was higher than all other profiles, with the lowest cost (US$17.93) among the low health literacy profile (Profile 6). Compared with Profile 4, caregivers with high health literacy (Profile 1) spent more on managing malaria in children, while those with the lowest health literacy (Profile 7) spent less. CONCLUSION: The current study presents a snapshot of malaria treatment costs, and argues that low health literacy may lead to increased costs due to possible reinfections from delayed healthcare use. There is a need for longitudinal studies to understand causal relationship between health literacy and household expenses on malaria treatment to inform policy development and interventions. LAY SUMMARY: This study explores the impact of caregiver health literacy levels on the cost of managing malaria incidents in children under five in Ghana. High health-literate caregivers incurred the highest total household cost at US$24.77, with US$17.93 incurred by lower health-literate caregivers per malaria episode.",,pubmed

Therefore, there is a need to explore the syndemic effects of psychosocial and structural factors on HIV risk behaviors to better explain the multilevel factors shaping HIV disparities among black women. Methods: This analysis uses baseline data (May 2009-August 2010) from non-Hispanic black women enrolled in the HIV Prevention Trials Network 064 Women's Seroincidence Study (HPTN 064) and the American Community Survey 5-year estimates from 2007 to 2011. Three parameterizations of syndemic factors were applied in this analysis a cumulative syndemic index, three syndemic groups reflecting the level of influence (psychosocial syndemic group, participant-level structural syndemic group, and a neighborhood-level structural syndemic group), and syndemic factor groups. Clustered mixed effects log-binomial analyses measured the relationship of each syndemic parameterization on HIV risk behaviors in 1,347 black women enrolled in HPTN 064. Results: A higher syndemic score was significantly associated with increased prevalence of unknown HIV status of the last male sex partner (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) = 1.07, 95% confidence interval or CI 1.04-1.10), involvement in exchange sex (aPR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.14-1.20), and multiple sex partners (aPR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.06-1.09) in the last 6 months. A dose-response relationship was observed between the number of syndemic groups and HIV risk behaviors, therefore, being in multiple syndemic groups was significantly associated with increased prevalence of reporting HIV risk behaviors compared with being in one syndemic group. In addition, being in all three syndemic groups was associated with increased prevalence of unknown HIV status of the last male sex partner (aPR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.43-1.95) and multiple sex partners (aPR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.36-1.72).

Using structured surveys, we investigated the sociodemographic factors associated with late HIV diagnosis, a topic with limited existing research. Results indicate that older age groups were associated with an increased risk of late diagnosis compared to the 18-24 age group. Among the demographic variables studied, only age showed a consistent association with late HIV diagnosis. This study underscores the importance of targeted interventions to address HIV diagnosis disparities among MSM in Ghana, particularly for older age groups. The findings emphasize the need for tailored interventions addressing age-related disparities in timely diagnosis and engagement with medical services among this population.

We aimed to measure the level of real-world adherence during intensive phase and investigate the predictors and the risk of mortality and health outcomes of intensive phase non-adherence in tuberculosis patients. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a nationwide cohort study by linking the Korean National Tuberculosis Surveillance System and the National Health Information Database. METHODS: We included all incident drug-susceptible tuberculosis patients who initiated the regimens recommended by the World Health Organization from 2013 to 2018. Adherence was measured using the proportion of days covered (poor [<50%], moderate [50%-79%], and high [>/=80%]). We used logistic regression model to assess predictors and the Cox proportional hazard model to evaluate the risk of mortality and health outcomes with intensive phase non-adherence. RESULTS: Of 46,818 patients, there were 8% and 11% with poor and moderate adherent groups, respectively. Age >/=45 years, insulin use, and history of renal failure were predictors of non-adherence. Compared with high adherent group, poor and moderate adherent groups were associated with a substantial risk of mortality (poor: hazard ratio, 2.14 [95% confidence interval, 1.95-2.34]; moderate: 1.76 [1.62-1.92]). Similar trends were observed for health outcomes. Stratified analyses showed a higher risk of mortality in patients with medical aid, low income, and history of renal failure, systematic corticosteroids, and immunomodulators.

This paper focuses on the concept of vulnerability to both climate change and conflicts to explain why some locations are more likely to engage in armed conflicts than others in the presence of a similar level of exposure to climatic changes. In particular, by means of a Spatial Autoregressive Model, we identify a set of local-specific vulnerability factors that increase conflict risk in East Africa. We employ a georeferenced database with a resolution of 25 x 25 km, covering the period 1997-2016. Results from our analysis provide some interesting insights: first, climate change does not increase conflict risk per se, but only in the presence of pre-existing vulnerabilities. Second, resource access and socioeconomic factors play a key role in driving the climate-conflict nexus especially in urban areas. In particular, vulnerability is increased whenever power is not distributed in such a way as to ensure an equitable distribution of resources. Overall, our findings suggest that, by addressing vulnerability factors that prevent adaptive capacity and an equitable distribution of resources, societies may benefit in terms of both diminished conflict risk and alleviation of climate change impacts.",,pubmed

Polyvictimization is a useful theory and framework that allows for a nuanced understanding of lived adolescent experience patterns. Polyvictimization examinations are further enriched by person-centered analytical approaches. This study used latent class analysis to differentiate a sample of South African adolescents from highly deprived communities by their polyvictimization profiles and contextual violence risk and protective factors. Adolescents were sampled twice (2010/2011; 2011/2012), and data reflected their lifetime (sexual abuse) or recent (all other forms of assessed abuse/violence) violence victimizations, as well as individual, household, and community characteristics. Model fit indices supported a seven-class model with adolescents in high, moderate, and low polyvictimization classes. Adolescents in the high polyvictimization classes experienced a heavy burden of poverty and multiple forms of violence across contexts and were distinguished by HIV/AIDS and disability. Adolescents in the low polyvictimization class experienced relatively little violence, despite living in violent communities, and low household and individual burdens of HIV/AIDS and disability. Findings emphasize the importance of considering adolescent violence through a contextually sensitive polyvictimization lens to understand the complex web of violence that adolescents experience. This work supports previous research in low-resource South African settings highlighting the interconnected nature of violence, poverty, disability, and HIV/AIDS. Future research should explore these complex violence patterns and their effects, while program and policy actions must target and prevent adolescent violence especially for those impacted by poverty, disability, and HIV/AIDS.",,pubmed

Survey data were geospatially linked to precipitation data for 2014-2016, with local droughts defined as cumulative rainfall between 2014 and 2016 being in < 15th percentile of all 2-year periods over 1981-2016. Using multivariable logistic regression, stratified by sex and rural/urban residence, we examined associations between (a) drought and poverty, (b) wealth quintiles and sexual behaviours (transactional, high-risk, and intergenerational sex), (c) sexual behaviours and recently acquiring HIV, and (d) drought and recent HIV. Among 102,081 people, 31.5% resided in areas affected by drought during 2014-2016. Experiencing drought was positively associated with poverty for women and men in rural, but not urban, areas. For each group, increasing wealth was negatively associated with transactional sex. For rural women, intergenerational sex was positively associated with wealth. Women reporting each sexual behaviour had higher odds of recent HIV, with strong associations seen for high-risk sex, and, for urban women, intergenerational sex, with weaker associations among men. Women in rural areas who had been exposed to drought had higher odds of having recently acquired HIV (2.10 [95%CI: 1.17-3.77]), but not women in urban areas, or men. Droughts could potentially increase HIV transmission through increasing poverty and then sexual risk behaviours, particularly among women in rural areas.",,pubmed

We used data from the 2005-2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N = 541,921). In each racial/ethnic group, the prevalence rates of past-year and past-month tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine use, and past-year alcohol and illicit drug use disorders were estimated by HIV status. A series of logistic regressions with the interaction term of HIV x race/ethnicity were performed to examine race/ethnicity's moderating effect on the HIV-substance use associations, while controlling for sociodemographic factors and survey year. Moderation analysis showed that HIV status's association with the risks of past-year tobacco use (AOR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.01-2.75), past-year cocaine use (AOR = 3.80, 95% CI = 1.91-7.57), past-month cocaine use (AOR = 5.34, 95% CI = 2.10-13.60), and past-year alcohol use disorder (AOR = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.29-4.92) differed significantly between Black and White adults.

Households were selected by two stage random sampling method. Study was done by face-to-face interview, review of medical records and observation of the households. SPSS software was used for data analysis. Multivariable logistic regression (hierarchical model) was done and p-value equal to or less than 0.05 was taken as significant. RESULTS: The prevalence of malaria infection among participants and household level risks of malaria infection were found to be 6.1%, 1.8% and 18.8%, 6.7%, respectively in the urban and rural areas. Significant predictors of malaria infection were households with >/=5 family members [AOR=2.91CI (1.19-7.15)], households not using any mosquito protective measures [AOR=3.71CI (1.04-13.13)], presence of mosquito breeding places [AOR=4.93CI (1.53-15.93)], absence of effective window screen [AOR=3.19CI (1.16-8.71)], absence of separate kitchen [AOR=2.38CI (1.06-5.34)], and inadequate lighting condition in the house [AOR=4.35CI (1.78-10.64)]. INTERPRETATION CONCLUSION: This study provides important insights into the epidemiology of malaria in a high and low-transmission setting in West Bengal, India. Intensified efforts strengthening community mobilization for preventing breeding places for mosquito. Policy should strengthen investment in housing programs that may complement reduction of malaria transmission. Disease reduction effects of Government and local non-governmental organizations should be directed towards those areas in order to decrease disease load.",,pubmed

STUDY DESIGN: This was an ecological study. METHODS: Descriptive analysis, spatial and space-time scan, correlation analysis, and regression analysis were carried out, based on cases of TB in Sichuan Province and ecological data from 2006 to 2017, to explore the characters of TB and ecological factors, using the transfer function-noise model to forecast the trend of TB until 2035. RESULTS: Factors affecting the incidence of TB, increasing per capita green area, reporting status of TB among Tibetans and Yi minorities, comprehensive treatment management, total cost of TB per capita for urban residents, proportion of males with high school education, 20 to 20 h of 24-h accumulated precipitation, reducing HIV at the same time as AIDS deaths, the increase in the proportion of males in junior high school education, and the increase in the number of registered TB cases can reduce the incidence of TB. CONCLUSIONS: There was concentration mainly on enhanced control of the environment and society measures, helpful in guiding government planning to control TB. Reinforcement is required to reduce the TB of population aged 15-24 and aged 25-64 in socioeconomic level by 2035.",,pubmed
A176,Complete sources of cluster variation on the risk of under-five malaria in Uganda: a multilevel-weighted mixed effects logistic regression model approach.,10.1186/s12936-023-04756-3,Natuhamya C; Makumbi F; Mukose AD; Ssenkusu JM,2023.0,Malaria journal,"BACKGROUND: Malaria, a major cause of mortality worldwide is linked to a web of determinants ranging from individual to contextual factors. This calls for examining the magnitude of the effect of clustering within malaria data. Regrettably, researchers usually ignore cluster variation on the risk of malaria and also apply final survey weights in multilevel modelling instead of multilevel weights. This most likely produces biased estimates, misleads inference and lowers study power. The objective of this study was to determine the complete sources of cluster variation on the risk of under-five malaria and risk factors associated with under-five malaria in Uganda. METHODS: This study applied a multilevel-weighted mixed effects logistic regression model to account for both individual and contextual factors. RESULTS: Every additional year in a child's age was positively associated with malaria infection (AOR = 1.42; 95% CI 1.33-1.52). Children whose mothers had at least a secondary school education were less likely to suffer from malaria infection (AOR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.30-0.95) as well as those who dwelled in households in the two highest wealth quintiles (AOR = 0.42; 95% CI 0.27-0.64). An increase in altitude by 1 m was negatively associated with malaria infection (AOR = 0.98; 95% CI 0.97-0.99). About 77% of the total variation in the positive testing for malaria was attributable to differences between enumeration areas (ICC = 0.77; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Interventions towards reducing the burden of under-five malaria should be prioritized to improve individual-level characteristics compared to household-level features. Enumeration area (EA) specific interventions may be more effective compared to household specific interventions.",,pubmed

These three diseases share respiratory droplets through coughing or sneezing as the main mode of transmission but differ in incubation time, with COVID-19 having a short and leprosy a long incubation time. Consequently, contacts of a patient are at higher risk of infection and developing these diseases. There might be scope for combined preventive measures, but a better understanding of the geographical distribution and relevant socioeconomic risk factors of the three diseases is needed first. This study aims to describe the geographic distribution of COVID-19, TB and leprosy incidence and to identify common socioeconomic risk factors. METHODS: The total number of new cases of COVID-19, TB and leprosy, as well as socioeconomic and demographic variables, were retrieved from official registers. The geographical distribution of COVID-19, TB and leprosy rates per neighbourhood was visualised in Quantum GIS, and spatial autocorrelation was measured with Moran's I in GeoDa. A spatial regression model was applied to understand the association between COVID-19, TB, leprosy rates, and socioeconomic factors. RESULTS: COVID-19 and TB showed a more homogenous distribution, whereas leprosy is located more in the south and west of Fortaleza. One neighbourhood (Pedras) in the southeast was identified as high endemic for all three diseases. Literacy was a socioeconomic risk factor for all three diseases: a high literacy rate increases the risk of COVID-19, and a low literacy rate (i.e., illiteracy) increases the risk of TB and leprosy. In addition, high income was associated with COVID-19, while low income with TB. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the similar mode of transmission, COVID-19, TB and leprosy show a different distribution of cases in Fortaleza. In addition, associated risk factors are related to wealth in COVID-19 and to poverty in TB and leprosy. These findings may support policymakers in developing (partially combined) primary and secondary prevention considering the efficient use of resources.",,pubmed

DESIGN: Study participants were enrolled in Shamba Maisha , a cluster randomized controlled trial of an agricultural intervention conducted among PWH across 16 health facilities during 2016-2020. Intervention participants received a water pump, seeds, and agricultural and financial training; control participants received standard of HIV care. METHODS: We assessed men's views on masculinity and gender roles via the validated gender role conflict score (GRCS; range 18-78, higher = greater gender role conflict). We measured gender power imbalances among women via the validated Sexual Relationship Power Scale (SRPS), which combines subscales of relationship control and decision-making dominance (range 1-4, higher = female holds more power). We compared changes over the study period by arm using longitudinal multilevel difference-in-difference linear regression models accounting for clustering of facilities using the intention-to-treat cohort. RESULTS: We enrolled 720 participants (366 intervention, 354 control); 2-year retention was 94%. Median age was 40 and approximately 55% of participants were female. Among men, after 24-months the decrease in GRCS scores was 4.3 points greater in the intervention than the control arm ( P  < 0.001). Among women, the intervention resulted in 0.25 points greater increase in the SRPS compared to the control arm ( P  < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Shamba Maisha resulted in less gender role conflict in men and greater sexual relationship power for women. Agricultural livelihood interventions may be a powerful tool to improve gender power imbalances, which may subsequently mitigate poverty and food insecurity.",,pubmed

Emerging research indicates that socioeconomic instability may be a salient antecedent of meth use as men may be encouraged to engage in health-eroding activities, such as survival sex, to care for themselves, and then cope with instability-related stress via use of substances. We examined the degree to which indicators of socioeconomic instability, including homelessness and food insecurity, would directly, and indirectly, predict increases in meth use, via survival sex engagement. Hypotheses were tested using mediated path analysis with data from 100 YB-GBMSM in Atlanta, Georgia. Preliminary analysis results demonstrated positive associations between engaging in survival sex, food insecurity, homelessness, and living with HIV. Findings demonstrated that homelessness and food insecurity were directly associated with increased survival sex engagement but were not directly associated with meth use. Homelessness and food insecurity were indirectly associated with increased severity of meth use, via increased engagement in survival sex. Socioeconomic instability and survival sex engagement may be important intervention targets for future meth use intervention/prevention programming. Integrating programmatic components that address homelessness and food insecurity may decrease YB-GBMSM's need to rely on survival sex to meet their needs and decrease their likelihood of using meth as a result.",,pubmed

This review examines the evidence linking climate change to kidney diseases, with a focus on acute kidney injury (AKI). RECENT FINDINGS: A growing body of evidence documents the adverse impact of various environmental and occupational exposures on kidney health. Extreme heat exposure increases the risk for AKI in vulnerable populations, particularly outdoor workers. These effects are being seen in both developed and developing nations, impacting equatorial as well as more northern climates. Climate change is also increasing the risk of water-borne and vector-borne infections, which are important causes of AKI in tropical regions. Due to overlapping environmental and social risk factors, populations in low-income and middle-income countries are likely to be disproportionately affected by climate-related health impacts, including heightened risk for kidney diseases. SUMMARY: Climate change will adversely impact global kidney health over the course of the century through effects on temperature and risk of endemic infections. Alongside efforts to aggressively reduce carbon emissions, additional research is needed to guide public and environmental health policies aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change on human health.",,pubmed

Therefore, addressing the pressing challenges of energy poverty and promoting environmental sustainability in this region is of paramount importance. Consequently, this study appraises the relationship between energy poverty and ecological preservation in Sub-Saharan Africa from 2005 to 2020, using government effectiveness and regulatory quality as moderating variables. A combination of energy poverty indicators and an index of energy poverty computed via the principal component analysis method were applied to identify the link between energy poverty and ecological sustainability. The instrumental variable generalized method of moment technique was applied to address the likelihood of endogeneity issues, and the Driscoll-Kraay approach was employed to check the consistency of the instrumental variable generalized method of moment method. Key findings indicate that energy poverty expands the ecological footprint in Sub-Saharan Africa, leading to ecological deterioration, while the interaction with government effectiveness and regulatory quality further deteriorates the environment. Subsequently, the study provides several recommendations to mitigate the influence of energy poverty on the environment.",,pubmed

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to analyse the demographic characteristics and seropositivity of syphilis among blood donors from 2019 to 2021. The differences in the serological status of syphilis among different populations under different demographic factors were compared, and conditional logistic regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors for syphilis. RESULTS: The seropositivity rate of syphilis among blood donors in Huzhou City was 133/100,000, which decreased year by year. There were significant differences in the syphilis seropositivity rate among different groups in terms of age, education level, occupation, household registration, marital status and blood donation history (P < 0.05). The multivariate logistic regression model showed that all six factors, including age, education level, occupation, household registration, marital status and blood donation history, had significant effects on syphilis infection (P < 0.01), with OR values and 95% CIs of 2. 387 (1.381-4.127), 3.607 (1.609-8.086), 2.784 (1.657-4.679), 5.074 (1.865-13.804), 11.177 (3.481-35.888), and 11.244 (3.940-32.091), respectively.

Infectious diseases,"BACKGROUND: Although household contacts of patients with tuberculosis are known to be particularly vulnerable to tuberculosis, the published evidence focused on this group at high risk within the low-income and middle-income country context remains sparse. Using nationwide data from Brazil, we aimed to estimate the incidence and investigate the socioeconomic and clinical determinants of tuberculosis in a cohort of contacts of tuberculosis patients. METHODS: In this cohort study, we linked individual socioeconomic and demographic data from the 100 Million Brazilian Cohort to mortality data and tuberculosis registries, identified contacts of tuberculosis index patients diagnosed from Jan 1, 2004 to Dec 31, 2018, and followed up the contacts until the contact's subsequent tuberculosis diagnosis, the contact's death, or Dec 31, 2018. We investigated factors associated with active tuberculosis using multilevel Poisson regressions, allowing for municipality-level and household-level random effects. FINDINGS: We studied 420 854 household contacts of 137 131 tuberculosis index patients. During the 15 years of follow-up (median 4.4 years [IQR 1.9-7.6]), we detected 8953 contacts with tuberculosis. The tuberculosis incidence among contacts was 427.8 per 100 000 person-years at risk (95% CI 419.1-436.8), 16-times higher than the incidence in the general population (26.2 [26.1-26.3]) and the risk was prolonged. Tuberculosis incidence was associated with the index patient being preschool aged (<5 years; adjusted risk ratio 4.15 [95% CI 3.26-5.28]) or having pulmonary tuberculosis (2.84 [2.55-3.17]). INTERPRETATION: The high and sustained risk of tuberculosis among contacts reinforces the need to systematically expand and strengthen contact tracing and preventive treatment policies in Brazil in order to achieve national and international targets for tuberculosis elimination.

Schistosoma haematobium species are blamable for causing urinary schistosomiasis. The infected person, specifically children, may be carrying the disease. This systematic review aimed to identify the current knowledge of urinary Schistosmiasis in children or USC on its epidemiology, risk factors, and challenges to spread the understanding of controlling the disease and reducing the complications. METHOD: In November 2021, a systematic computer-aided literature review was conducted using PubMed, SCOPUS and Web of Science, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. The results were updated in February 2022. We only used papers that have at least the abstract available in English. Relevant articles were screened, duplicates were deleted, eligibility criteria were applied, and studies that met the criteria were reviewed. The keywords Human Schistosoma infections, prevalence, risk factors and challenges were included. The protocol for the review was registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42022311609). Pooled prevalence rates were calculated using the programme R version 4.2.1. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic and p-value. A narrative approach was used to describe risk factors and challenges. Studies were selected and finalised based on the review question to prioritise. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Mixed-Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT). RESULTS: A total of 248 publications met the requirements for inclusion. Fifteen articles were included in this review, with the result showing high heterogeneity. The pooled prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis in children is 4% (95% confidence interval (CI)). Age, poor socioeconomic status, education, exposure to river water, and poor sanitation are the risk factors identified in this review. Challenges are faced due to limitations of clean water, lack of water resources, and poor hygiene. CONCLUSION: Modifiable risk factors such as poor knowledge and practices must be addressed immediately. Healthcare providers and schools could accomplish engaging in practical promotional activities. Communicating the intended messages to raise community awareness of urinary schistosomiasis is critical.",,pubmed

The main objective of this overview was to evaluate the influence of environmental factors, risk factors related to the host, and control strategies on the prevalence of STH in different regions of the world. METHODS: LILACS, PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Clinical Trials (gray literature) databases were used to obtain the systematic reviews published until December 2020. The methodological quality of systematic reviews was assessed using the standard criteria recommended by AMSTAR. RESULTS: The initial results of the bibliographic search identified 1448 articles, of which 66 studies were read in full and 16 met the inclusion criteria. All the reviews included in this overview associated variations in the global prevalence of STH with at least one of the factors related to the environment, host, and/or control strategies. Climate, temperature, soil moisture, precipitation, mass drug administration, lack of access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), and non-use of footwear were considered the main factors associated with the prevalence of STH. Socioeconomic factors, low educational level, and wearing shoes were universal factors related to prevalence, regardless of the location studied. CONCLUSION: The combination of environmental factors, with factors associated with hosts that predispose infection and reinfection of helminths, as well as the adoption of control strategies based on the treatment of target populations instead of the entire population, influenced the prevalence of STH in all the continents evaluated.",,pubmed

Disease primers,"Lung disease encompasses acute, infectious processes and chronic, non-infectious processes such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and lung cancer. People living with HIV are at increased risk of both acute and chronic lung diseases. Although the use of effective antiretroviral therapy has diminished the burden of infectious lung disease, people living with HIV experience growing morbidity and mortality from chronic lung diseases. A key risk factor for HIV-associated lung disease is cigarette smoking, which is more prevalent in people living with HIV than in uninfected people. Other risk factors include older age, history of bacterial pneumonia, Pneumocystis pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis and immunosuppression. Mechanistic investigations support roles for aberrant innate and adaptive immunity, local and systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, altered lung and gut microbiota, and environmental exposures such as biomass fuel burning in the development of HIV-associated lung disease. Assessment, prevention and treatment strategies are largely extrapolated from data from HIV-uninfected people. Smoking cessation is essential. Data on the long-term consequences of HIV-associated lung disease are limited. Efforts to continue quantifying the effects of HIV infection on the lung, especially in low-income and middle-income countries, are essential to advance our knowledge and optimize respiratory care in people living with HIV.",,pubmed

This heterogeneity in risk is associated with factors including demographic characteristics, individual behaviours, home construction, and environmental conditions, the importance of which varies by setting, making prediction difficult. This study attempted to compare the ability of statistical models to predict malaria risk at the household level using either (i) free easily-obtained remotely-sensed data or (ii) results from a resource-intensive household survey. METHODS: The results of a household malaria survey conducted in 3 villages in western Uganda were combined with remotely-sensed environmental data to develop predictive models of two outcomes of interest (1) a positive ultrasensitive rapid diagnostic test (uRDT) and (2) inpatient admission for malaria within the last year. Generalized additive models were fit to each result using factors from the remotely-sensed data, the household survey, or a combination of both. Using a cross-validation approach, each model's ability to predict malaria risk for out-of-sample households (OOS) and villages (OOV) was evaluated. RESULTS: Models fit using only environmental variables provided a better fit and higher OOS predictive power for uRDT result (AIC = 362, AUC = 0.736) and inpatient admission (AIC = 623, AUC = 0.672) compared to models using household variables (uRDT AIC = 376, Admission AIC = 644, uRDT AUC = 0.667, Admission AUC = 0.653). Combining the datasets did not result in a better fit or higher OOS predictive power for uRDT results (AIC = 367, AUC = 0.671), but did for inpatient admission (AIC = 615, AUC = 0.683). Household factors performed best when predicting OOV uRDT results (AUC = 0.596) and inpatient admission (AUC = 0.553), but not much better than a random classifier. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that residual malaria risk is driven more by the external environment than home construction within the study area, possibly due to transmission regularly occurring outside of the home. Additionally, they suggest that when predicting malaria risk the benefit may not outweigh the high costs of attaining detailed information on household predictors. Instead, using remotely-sensed data provides an equally effective, cost-efficient alternative.",,pubmed

The present study sought to characterize the spatial distribution of childhood tuberculosis notification rates in continental Portugal; identify high-risk areas; and evaluate the association between childhood tuberculosis notification rates and socioeconomic deprivation. METHODS: Using hierarchical Bayesian spatial models, we analyzed the geographic distribution of pediatric tuberculosis notification rates across 278 municipalities between 2016 and 2020 and determined high-risk and low-risk areas. We used the Portuguese version of the European Deprivation Index to estimate the association between childhood tuberculosis and area-level socioeconomic deprivation. RESULTS: Notification rates ranged from 1.8 to 13.15 per 100,000 children under 5 years of age. We identified seven high-risk areas, the relative risk of which was significantly above the study area average. All seven high-risk areas were located in the metropolitan area of Porto or Lisbon. There was a significant relationship between socioeconomic deprivation and pediatric tuberculosis notification rates (relative risk = 1.16; Bayesian credible interval, 1.05-1.29). CONCLUSIONS: Identified high-risk and socioeconomically deprived areas should constitute target areas for tuberculosis control, and these data should be integrated with other risk factors to define more precise criteria for BCG vaccination.",,pubmed

While an association between poverty and malaria has been demonstrated, a clearer understanding of explicit mechanisms through which socioeconomic position (SEP) influences malaria risk is needed to guide the design of more comprehensive interventions for malaria risk mitigation. This systematic review provides an overview of the current evidence on the mediators of socioeconomic disparities in malaria in SSA. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Web of Science for randomised controlled trials, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies published in English between January 1, 2000 to May 31, 2022. Further studies were identified following reviews of reference lists of the studies included. We included studies that either (1) conducted a formal mediation analysis of risk factors on the causal pathway between SEP and malaria infections or (2) adjusted for these potential mediators as confounders on the association between SEP and malaria using standard regression models. At least two independent reviewers appraised the studies, conducted data extraction, and assessed risk of bias. A systematic overview is presented for the included studies. RESULTS: We identified 41 articles from 20 countries in SSA for inclusion in the final review. Of these, 30 studies used cross-sectional design, and 26 found socioeconomic inequalities in malaria risk. Three formal mediation analyses showed limited evidence of mediation of food security, housing quality, and previous antimalarial use. Housing, education, insecticide-treated nets, and nutrition were highlighted in the remaining studies as being protective against malaria independent of SEP, suggesting potential for mediation. However, methodological limitations included the use of cross-sectional data, insufficient confounder adjustment, heterogeneity in measuring both SEP and malaria, and generally low or moderate-quality studies. No studies considered exposure mediator interactions or considered identifiability assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies have conducted formal mediation analyses to elucidate pathways between SEP and malaria. Findings indicate that food security and housing could be more feasible (structural) intervention targets. Further research using well-designed longitudinal studies and improved analysis would illuminate the current sparse evidence into the pathways between SEP and malaria and adduce evidence for more potential targets for effective intervention.",,pubmed

HIV,"BACKGROUND: Poverty and social inequality are risk factors for poor health outcomes in patients with HIV/AIDS. In addition to eligibility, cash transfer programmes can be divided into two categories: those with specific requirements (conditional cash transfers [CCTs]) and those without specific requirements (unconditional cash transfers). Common CCT requirements include health care (eg, undergoing an HIV test) and education (eg, children attending school). Trials assessing the effect of cash transfer programmes on HIV/AIDS outcomes have yielded divergent findings. This review aimed to summarise evidence to evaluate the effects of cash transfer programmes on HIV/AIDS prevention and care outcomes. METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, LILACS, WHO IRIS, PAHO-IRIS, BDENF, Secretaria Estadual de Saude SP, Localizador de Informacao em Saude, Coleciona SUS, BINACIS, IBECS, CUMED, SciELO, and Web of Science up to Nov 28, 2022. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of cash transfer programmes on HIV incidence, HIV testing, retention in HIV care, and antiretroviral therapy adherence, and conducted risk of bias and quality of evidence assessments using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to combine studies and calculate risk ratios (RRs). Subgroup analyses were performed using conditionality types (ie, school attendance or health care). The protocol was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021274452. FINDINGS: 16 RCTs, which included 5241 individuals, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these, 13 studies included conditionalities for receiving cash transfer programmes. The results showed that receiving a cash transfer was associated with lowered HIV incidence among individuals who had to meet health-care conditionalities (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.98) and with increased retention in HIV care for pregnant women (1.14, 95% CI 1.03-1.27). No significant effect was observed for HIV testing (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.18-1.12) or antiretroviral therapy adherence (1.13, 0.73-1.75). Lower risk of bias was observed for HIV incidence and having an HIV test. The strength of available evidence can be classified as moderate. INTERPRETATION: Cash transfer programmes have a positive effect on mitigating HIV incidence for individuals who have to meet health-care conditionalities and on increasing retention in HIV care for pregnant women. These results show the potential of cash transfer programmes for HIV prevention and care, especially among people in extreme poverty, and highlight that cash transfer programmes must be considered when developing policies for HIV/AIDS control, as indicated by the UNAIDS 95-95-95 target of the HIV care continuum.

A191,Temporal trends in inequalities of the burden of HIV/AIDS across 186 countries and territories.,10.1186/s12889-023-15873-8,Deng P; Chen M; Si L,2023.0,BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) has reported that HIV/AIDS continues to take a disproportionate toll on global health. However, the trends in global inequality of HIV/AIDS burden have remained ambiguous over the past two decades. The objectives of our study were to assess the socioeconomic inequalities, and temporal trends of HIV/AIDS across 186 countries and territories from 2000 to 2019. METHODS: We extracted data from the GBD 2019, and conducted a cross-national time-series analysis. Age-standardized disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) rates were used to measure the global burden of HIV/AIDS. Gross national income (GNI) per capita was used to approximate the national socioeconomic status. Linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between age-standardized DALY rates due to HIV/AIDS and GNI per capita. The concentration curve and concentration index (CI) were generated to evaluate the cross-national socioeconomic inequality of HIV/AIDS burden. A joinpoint regression analysis was used to quantify the changes in trends in socioeconomic inequality of HIV/AIDS burden from 2000 to 2019. RESULTS: A decrease in age-standardized DALY rates for HIV/AIDS occurred in 132 (71%) of 186 countries/territories from 2000 to 2019, of which 52 (39%) countries/territories achieved a decrease in DALYs of more than 50%, and 27 (52%) of the 52 were from sub-Saharan Africa. The concentration curves of the age-standardized DALY rates of HIV/AIDS were above the equality line from 2000 to 2019. The CI rose from - 0.4625 (95% confidence interval - 0.6220 to -0.2629) in 2000 to -0.4122 (95% confidence interval - 0.6008 to -0.2235) in 2019. A four-phase trend of changes in the CIs of age-standardized DALY rates for HIV/AIDS was observed across 2000 to 2019, with an average increase of 0.6% (95% confidence interval 0.4 to 0.8, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Globally, the burden of HIV/AIDS has decreased over the past two decades, accompanied by a trend of narrowing cross-country inequalities of HIV/AIDS burden. Moreover, the burden of HIV/AIDS continues to fall primarily in low-income countries.",,pubmed

This study examined the association between extreme rainfall and acute respiratory infection (ARI) in children aged <5 years in sub-Saharan Africa. SETTING: Study data were taken from recent (2006-2020) Demographic and Health Survey data sets from 33 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. PARTICIPANTS: 280 157 children aged below 5 years were included. OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportions of ARI according to individual, household and geographical characteristics were compared using the chi(2) test. The association between extreme rainfall (>/=90th percentile) and ARI was examined using multivariate logistic regression for 10 of 33 countries with an adequate sample size of ARI and extreme rainfall events. The model was adjusted for temperature, comorbidity and sociodemographic factors as covariates. Stratification analyses by climate zone were also performed. RESULTS: The prevalence of ARI in children aged <5 years ranged from 1.0% to 9.1% across sub-Saharan Africa. By country, no significant association was observed between extreme rainfall and ARI, except in Nigeria (OR: 2.14, 95% CI 1.06 to 4.31). Larger effect estimates were observed in the tropical zone (OR: 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.84) than in the arid zone (OR: 0.72, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.95), although the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: We found no association between extreme rainfall and ARI in sub-Saharan Africa. Effect estimates tended to be larger in the tropical zone where intense rainfall events regularly occur. Comprehensive studies to investigate subsequent extreme climate events, such as flooding, are warranted in the future.",,pubmed

Identifying risk factors will provide evidence for clinicians to strongly relate their diagnosis to the associated pathology. Studies were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar, systematically reviewed, and meta-analyzed for various risk factors and their association with pediatric TB. Meta-analysis depicted that four out of eleven risk factors were significant-contact with known TB cases (OR 6.42 [3.85,10.71]), exposure to smoke (OR 2.61 [1.24, 5.51]), overcrowding in the houses (OR 2.29 [1.04, 5.03]), and, poor household conditions (OR 2.65 [1.38, 5.09]). Although significant odds ratio estimates were obtained, we observed heterogeneity in the studies included. Conclusion: The study findings demand the constant screening of risk factors such as contact with known TB cases, exposure to smoke, overcrowding, and, poor household conditions for the development of pediatric TB. What is Known: * Knowledge of the risk factors of a disease is of utmost importance in the planning and institution of its control measures. Well-established risk factors in the occurrence of TB in the pediatric group are HIV positivity, older age and close contact with a known case of TB. What is New: * In addition to what is already known; this review and meta-analysis has identified exposure to indoor smoking, overcrowding and poor household conditions as important risk factors for developing pediatric TB. * Implications of the study: The findings highlight that in addition to routine contact screening for the pediatric group, the children living in poor household conditions and getting exposed to passive indoor smoking demand more attention to prevent the development of pediatric TB.",,pubmed

This risk maybe even higher in adult survivors of perinatal HIV infection because of prolonged exposure to HIV and its treatments. Nutritional deprivation in early life may further increase CVD risk. SETTING: Botswana-Baylor Children's Clinical Centre of Excellence, Gaborone. METHODS: This study examined dyslipidemia in 18- to 24-year olds with perinatally-acquired HIV with and without linear growth retardation (""stunting""). Anthropometry and lipid profiles were measured following a minimum 8-hour fast. Stunting was defined by a height-for-age z-score of <2 SDs below the mean. Dyslipidemia was defined by non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) of >/=130 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of >/=100 mg/dL, or HDL of <40 mg/dL for male subjects and <50 mg/dL for female subjects. We used logistic regression to determine whether dyslipidemia was associated with stunting while adjusting for demographic and HIV treatment variables. RESULTS: Of 107 young adults (46 males; 61 females) enrolled, 36 (33.6%) were stunted. Prevalence of dyslipidemia was 11.2%, 24.3%, and 65.4% for high non-HDL-C, high LDL-C, and low HDL-C, respectively. In univariable analysis, being stunted was associated with elevated LDL-C (odds ratio [OR], 2.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.02 to 6.25) but not with elevated non-HDL-C (OR = 2.17; 95% CI: = 0.65 to 7.28) or with low HDL-C (OR = 0.75; 95% CI: = 0.33 to 1.73). The association between stunting and elevated LDL-C (OR = 4.40; 95% CI: = 1.49 to 12.98) remained significant after controlling for measured confounders. CONCLUSION: Dyslipidemia was common among perinatally HIV-infected youth and those with evidence of early nutritional deprivation who were more likely to have elevated LDL-C.",,pubmed

We examined the mediation pathways between an economic empowerment intervention and ART adherence among ALWHIV. METHODS: This cluster-randomized controlled trial (2012-2018) recruited 702 ALWHIV aged 10-16 in Uganda between January 2014 and December 2015. We randomized 39 clinics into the control (n = 344) or intervention group (n = 358). The intervention comprised a child development account, four microenterprise workshops, and 12 mentorship sessions. We used six self-reported items to measure adherence at 24 months, 36 months, and 48 months. We used structural equation modeling to assess the mediation effects through mental health and adherence self-efficacy, on adherence. We ran models corresponding to the 24, 36, and 48 months of follow-up. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 12 years, and 56% were female. At 36 (model 2) and 48 months (model 3), the intervention had a significant indirect effect on ART adherence [B = 0.069, beta = 0.039 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.005-0.074)], and [B = 0.068, beta = 0.040 (95% CI: 0.010-0.116)], respectively. In both models, there was a specific mediation effect through mental health [B = 0.070, beta = 0.040 (95% CI: 0.007-0.063)], and [B = 0.039, beta = 0.040 (95% CI: 0.020-0.117)]. Overall, 49.1%, 90.7%, and 36.8% of the total effects were mediated in models, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. DISCUSSION: EE interventions improve adherence, by improving mental health functioning. These findings warrant the need to incorporate components that address mental health challenges in programs targeting poverty to improve ART adherence in low-income settings.",,pubmed

East Java is the province that has the highest leprosy cases. The Provincial Government socialized the East Java Leprosy Eradication Program, which targets a maximum of one leprosy case per 10,000 residents. We propose spatially varying regression coefficients models to evaluate the effects of risk factors on of leprosy cases in East Java, use Geographically Weighted Generalized Poisson Regression and Geographically Weighted Negative Binomial Regression (GWNBR) models. The best models GWNBR categorize municipalities into six groups based on variables that have a significant impact on leprosy cases. The percentage of households with access to adequate sanitation is a significant factor in determining leprosy cases in all municipalities in East Java. We can conclude that clean and healthy living behavior, health facilities, and health workers significantly affect the number of leprosy cases in East Java.",,pubmed
A197,The impact of child mortality on fertility in South Africa: Do child support grants and antiretroviral treatment matter?,10.1371/journal.pone.0284032,Bidzha ML; Johnson LF; Dorrington RE; Ngepah N; Greyling T,2023.0,PloS one,"This paper investigates the effect of under-five mortality, child support grant (CSG) coverage and the rollout of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on fertility in South Africa. The study employs the quality-quantity trade-off framework to analyse the direct and indirect factors affecting fertility using the two stage least squares fixed effects instrumental variable approach. The analysis uses balanced panel data covering nine provinces from 2001-2016. This period was characterised by significant increases in the child support grant coverage and ART coverage. Furthermore, this period was characterised by a significant decline in the under-five mortality rate. We find no evidence to support the hypothesis that increases in the CSG coverage are associated with an increase in fertility. This finding aligns with previous literature suggesting that there are no perverse incentives for childbearing associated with the child support grant. On the other hand, results indicate that an increase in ART coverage is associated with an increase in fertility. Results also show that a decrease in under-five mortality is associated with a decline in fertility over the sample period. HIV prevalence, education, real GDP per capita, marriage prevalence and contraceptive prevalence are also important determinants of fertility in South Africa. Although the scale up of ART has improved health outcomes, it also appears to have increased fertility in HIV-positive women. The ART programme should therefore be linked with further family planning initiatives to minimise unintended pregnancies.",,pubmed

Diabetes has been identified as a major risk factor for the development of TB. Despite the fact that diabetes imparts a substantially lower risk of TB (3-fold) as compared to HIV (>20-fold), in communities where the number of DM patients is high, the contribution of diabetes to TB might be bigger than HIV. METHODS: This review will focus on the link between TB and diabetes, which is now one of the most important topics for physicians since diabetes impacts the clinical presentation and outcome of TB and vice versa. RESULTS: Though TB is more common in type 1 diabetes, the extent of the problem in type 2 diabetes should be taken into account with equal care, as type 2 diabetes affects a substantially higher number of individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes patients are more vulnerable to infections because of their impaired immune systems. Increased glucose level leads to a rise in the infection status among TB patients and also leads to a rise in various complications. Extensive and increased screening for both TB and DM over years can help diagnose disease priorly and help in better management. TB, when diagnosed in its early stages, can be easily eradicated.",,pubmed

We evaluated the population effects of a program implemented in two provinces in Mozambique, focusing on child, maternal and HIV/AIDS care and knowledge. We used a difference-in-difference estimation strategy applied to data on mothers from the Demographic Health Surveys, linked to information on their closest health facility. The impact of PBF was limited. HIV testing during antenatal care increased, particularly for women who were wealthier, more educated, or residing in Gaza Province. Knowledge about transmission of HIV from mother-to-child, and its prevention, increased, particularly for women who were less wealthy, less educated, or residing in Nampula Province. Exploiting the roll-out by facility, we found that the effects were concentrated on less wealthy and less educated women, whose closest facility was in the referral network of a PBF facility. Results suggest that HIV testing and knowledge promotion increased in the whole district, as a strategy to boost referral for highly incentivized HIV services delivered in PBF facilities. However, demand-side constraints may prevent the use of those services.",,pubmed

Indeed, most recent estimates suggest that 50% of the total attributable risk of COPD may be related to air pollution. In response, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Scientific Committee performed a comprehensive review on this topic, qualitatively synthesised the evidence to date and proffered recommendations to mitigate the risk. The review found that both gaseous and particulate components of air pollution are likely contributors to COPD. There are no absolutely safe levels of ambient air pollution and the relationship between air pollution levels and respiratory events is supra-linear. Wildfires and extreme weather events such as heat waves, which are becoming more common owing to climate change, are major threats to COPD patients and acutely increase their risk of morbidity and mortality. Exposure to air pollution also impairs lung growth in children and as such may lead to developmental COPD. GOLD recommends strong public health policies around the world to reduce ambient air pollution and for implementation of public warning systems and advisories, including where possible the use of personalised apps, to alert patients when ambient air pollution levels exceed acceptable minimal thresholds. When household particulate content exceeds acceptable thresholds, patients should consider using air cleaners and filters where feasible. Air pollution is a major health threat to patients living with COPD and actions are urgently required to reduce the morbidity and mortality related to poor air quality around the world.",,pubmed
A201,DiD IT?: a differences-in-differences investigation tool to quantify the impact of local incidents on public health using real-time syndromic surveillance health data.,10.1017/S0950268823000444,Morbey R; Todkill D; DeAngelis D; Charlett A; Elliot A,2023.0,Epidemiology and infection,"Syndromic surveillance was originally developed to provide early warning compared to laboratory surveillance, but it is increasing used for real-time situational awareness. When a potential threat to public health is identified, a rapid assessment of its impact is required for public health management. When threats are localised, analysis is more complex as local trends need to be separated from national trends and differences compared to unaffected areas may be due to confounding factors such as deprivation or age distributions. Accounting for confounding factors usually requires an in-depth study, which takes time. Therefore, a tool is required which can provide a rapid estimate of local incidents using syndromic surveillance data.Here, we present 'DiD IT?', a new investigation tool designed to measure the impact of local threats to public health. 'DiD IT?' uses a difference-in-differences statistical approach to account for temporal and spatial confounding and provide a direct estimate of impact due to incidents. Temporal confounding differences are estimated by comparing unaffected locations during and outside of exposure periods. Whilst spatial confounding differences are estimated by comparing unaffected and exposed locations outside of the exposure period. Any remaining differences can be considered to be the direct effect of the local incident.We illustrate the potential utility of the tool through four examples of localised health protection incidents in England. The examples cover a range of data sources including general practitioner (GP) consultations, emergency department (ED) attendances and a telehealth call and online health symptom checker; and different types of incidents including, infectious disease outbreak, mass-gathering, extreme weather and an industrial fire. The examples use the UK Health Security Agency's ongoing real-time syndromic surveillance systems to show how results can be obtained in near real-time.The tool identified 700 additional online difficulty breathing assessments associated with a severe thunderstorm, 53 additional GP consultations during a mumps outbreak, 2-3 telehealth line calls following an industrial fire and that there was no significant increase in ED attendances during the G7 summit in 2021.DiD IT? can provide estimates for the direct impact of localised events in real-time as part of a syndromic surveillance system. Thus, it has the potential for enhancing surveillance and can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of extending national surveillance to a more granular local surveillance.",,pubmed

METHODS: This is a population-based cohort study with patients with TB >/=18 years notified from 1990 to 2018 in Denmark, compared with sex- and age-matched controls. Mortality was assessed in Kaplan-Meier models and risk factors for death were estimated in Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Overall mortality was twofold higher among people with TB compared with controls up to 15 years after TB diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.18, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.06-2.29, P <0.0001). Danes with TB were three times more likely to die than migrants (adjusted HR: 3.13, 95% CI: 2.84-3.45, P <0.0001). Risk factors for death included living alone, being unemployed, having low income, and comorbidities such as mental illness with substance abuse, lung diseases, hepatitis, and HIV. TB was the most common cause of death (21%), followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (7%), lung cancer (6%), alcoholic liver disease (5%), and mental illness with substance abuse (4%). CONCLUSION: People with TB had substantially inferior survival up to 15 years after TB diagnosis, in particular, socially disadvantaged Danes with TB with specific comorbidities. This may reflect unmet needs for enhanced treatment of other medical/social conditions during TB treatment.",,pubmed

METHODS: Information was extracted using pseudonymized registration data. Predictors of HBsAg seropositivity were explored in models that considered age, gender, ethnicity, time at the current practice, practice location and associated deprivation index, and presence of nationally endorsed screen indicators including pregnancy, men who have sex with men (MSM), history of injecting drug use (IDU), close HBV contact or imprisonment, and diagnosis of blood-borne or sexually transmitted infections. RESULTS: Among 6,975,119 individuals, 192,639 (2.8 %) had a screening record, including 3.6-38.6 % of those with a screen indicator, and 8065 (0.12 %) had a seropositive record. The odds of seropositivity were highest in London, in the most deprived neighborhoods, among minority ethnic groups, and in people with screen indicators. Seroprevalence exceeded 1 % in people from high-prevalence countries, MSM, close HBV contacts, and people with a history of IDU or a recorded diagnosis of HIV, HCV, or syphilis. Overall, 1989/8065 (24.7 %) had a recorded referral to specialist hepatitis care. CONCLUSIONS: In England, HBV infection is associated with poverty.

Children under five accounted for over two-thirds of all malaria deaths in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This scoping review aims to map evidence of the prevalence, contextual factors and health education interventions of malaria amongst children under 5 years (UN5) in SSA. METHOD: Four main databases (PubMed, Central, Dimensions and JSTOR) produced 27,841 records of literature. Additional searches in Google, Google Scholar and institutional repositories produced 37 records. Finally, 255 full-text records were further screened, and 100 records were used for this review. RESULTS: Low or no formal education, poverty or low income and rural areas are risk factors for malaria amongst UN5. Evidence on age and malnutrition as risk factors for malaria in UN5 is inconsistent and inconclusive. Furthermore, the poor housing system in SSA and the unavailability of electricity in rural areas and unclean water make UN5 more susceptible to malaria. Health education and promotion interventions have significantly reduced the malaria burden on UN5 in SSA. CONCLUSION: Well-planned and resourced health education and promotion interventions that focus on prevention, testing and treatment of malaria could reduce malaria burden amongst UN5 in SSA.",,pubmed

Mortality patterns for some groups, including Black individuals, are not as well known. The objective of this study was to assess cause-specific mortality for Black adults living in Canada. METHODS: Mortality inequalities between Black and White cohort members were estimated by sex using Cox proportional hazard models, based on data from the 2001, 2006 and 2011 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohorts (CanCHECs). The CanCHEC cycles were combined and followed for mortality between Census Day and December 31, 2016 or 2019, resulting in a follow-up period of 15.6, 13.6 or 8.6 years, depending on the CanCHEC cycle. RESULTS: Ischemic heart disease mortality was the leading cause of death among adult Black males (12.9%) and females (9.8%), as it is for adult White males (16.4%) and females (12.4%). Despite reduced risk of all-cause mortality among Black males and females, compared with White cohort members, there was notable increased risk for some cause-specific mortality. For instance, in the age-adjusted model, among the 25 causes of death examined, Black males had an increased risk of dying from four causes (HIV/AIDS, prostate cancer, diabetes mellitus and cerebrovascular disease), compared with White males. Similarly, Black females were at an increased risk for 6 causes of death (HIV/AIDS, stomach cancer, corpus uteri cancer, lymphomas and multiple myeloma, diabetes mellitus, and endocrine disorders) out of the 27 causes of death examined. These relative increased risks persisted for most causes of death after adjustment for differences in important social determinants of health. INTERPRETATION: Results showed substantial variability in the risk of dying by cause of death between Black and White cohort members. An important step in reducing health inequities is the routine identification and surveillance of different health outcomes by population groups. This study helps fill that information gap.",,pubmed
A207,Exploring HIV status as a mediator in the relationship of psychological distress with socio-demographic and health related factors in South Africa: findings from the 2012 nationally representative population-based household survey.,10.1186/s12981-022-00498-5,Ncitakalo N; Sigwadhi LN; Mabaso M; Joska J; Simbayi L,2023.0,AIDS research and therapy,"BACKGROUND: Psychological distress as measured by mental disorders like depression and anxiety is more prevalent in people living with HIV (PLHIV) than in the general population. However, the relationship between mental disorders and HIV is complex and bidirectional. Improved understanding of the relationship between mental disorders and HIV is important for designing interventions for this group. This paper explores the interrelationships of psychological distress with HIV and associated socio-demographic and health-related factors. METHODS: This secondary data analysis used the 2012 South African population-based household survey on HIV collected using a cross-sectional multi-stage stratified cluster sampling design. Generalized structural equation modelling (G-SEM) path analysis was used to explore the direct and indirect relationships of socio-demographic, health and HIV-related factors with psychological distress as measured by Kessler 10 scale using HIV status as a moderator variable. RESULTS: A total of 20,083 participants were included in the study, 21.7% reported psychological distress, of whom (32.6%) were HIV positive. In the final path model with HIV status as a moderator, psychological distress was significantly more likely among age group 25-49 years (AOR: 1.4 [95% CI 1.3-1.6]), age 50 years and older, (AOR: 1.4 [95% CI 1.2-1.6]), females (AOR: 1.6 [95% CI 1.4-1.8]), high risk drinkers (AOR: 1.9 [1.6-2.2]) hazardous drinkers (AOR: 4.4 [95% CI 3.1-6.3]), ever tested for HIV (AOR: 1.2 [95% CI 1.1-1.3]). Psychological distress was significantly less likely among the married [AOR: 0.8 (0.7-0.9)], other race groups [AOR: 0.5 (0.5-0.6)], those with secondary level education (AOR: 0.9 [95% CI 0.8-0.9]), and tertiary level education (AOR: 0.7 [95% CI 0.6-0.9]), those from rural informal [AOR: 0.8 (0.7-0.9)], and rural formal [AOR: 0.8 (0.7-0.9)] areas and those who rated their health as excellent/good [AOR: 0.4 (0.4-0.5)]. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the importance of designing tailored interventions targeted at psychological distress among PLHIV especially the elderly, females, those with no education and / or low education attainment and those residing in informal urban areas.",,pubmed
A208,Local resource mobilization for malaria vector control among Rwandan rice farmers: a pilot study into the role of community ownership.,10.1186/s41043-023-00345-x,Rulisa A; van Kempen L; Hakizimana E; Koenraadt CJM,2023.0,"Journal of health, population, and nutrition","BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests a vicious cycle between rice cultivation and malaria control in Rwanda. Rice fields offer an attractive breeding ground for malaria vectors, which increases the disease burden in rice farming communities, and, consequently, reduces productivity in the rice sector. Community-based larval source management in rice fields is propagated as a sustainable solution to break this cycle. A sense of agency and ownership of malaria control interventions, as well as the mobilization of resources at the local level, are often considered preconditions for success. However, an evidence gap exists regarding the interaction between the agentive and financial dimension of local sustainability. METHODS: We conduct a larviciding pilot involving three groups; one group where rice farmers sprayed their fields under expert supervision, one group where rice farmers organised the larviciding campaign themselves, and a (non-sprayed) control group. We test whether the difference in agency between the intervention groups affects farmers' willingness-to-pay for a larviciding campaign. Willingness-to-pay is elicited in a contingent valuation exercise, more specifically a bidding game, and is assessed both before and after the pilot (n = 288). Difference-in-difference estimates are computed, using a propensity score matching technique. Supplementary data were collected in a survey and two focus group discussions for triangulation. RESULTS: The high-agency (self-organised) group significantly outperforms the low-agency (expert-supervised) group in terms of maintaining its willingness to contribute financially. However, higher willingness-to-pay in the high-agency group does not appear to be driven by a stronger sense of ownership per se. The supplementary data indicate high levels of ownership in both treatment groups compared to the control group. A tentative explanation lies in diverging perceptions concerning the effectiveness of the pilot. CONCLUSIONS: The study supports the idea that community-led organization of larval source management can prove instrumental in mobilizing finance for malaria control in low-income settings where rice production interferes with the fight against malaria. However, the causality is complex. Feelings of ownership do not appear the main driver of willingness-to-pay, at least not directly, which opens up the possibility of initiating community-driven malaria control interventions that promote the agentive and financial dimension of local sustainability simultaneously.",,pubmed
A209,Motivating Personal Climate Action through a Safety and Health Risk Management Framework.,10.3390/ijerph20010007,Mullins-Jaime C; Wachter JK,2022.0,International journal of environmental research and public health,"BACKGROUND: There is overwhelming evidence the impacts of climate change present a probable threat to personal health and safety. However, traditional risk management approaches have not been applied to ameliorate the crises. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact on personal motivation for action of a communication intervention that framed climate change as a safety issue that can be mitigated through a safety and health risk management framework. Participants' perception of climate change in terms of its anthropogenicity, context and importance, perception as a personal threat, belief in the efficacy of human action, motivating drivers for action, knowledge of climate change impacts, perceived personal barriers to climate action, and short- and long-term preferences for mitigating actions were evaluated. In addition, this study assessed the role of personal worldview on motivation for climate action. METHODS: Through an online survey instrument embedded with a communication/education intervention, data were collected from N = 273 participants. Pre and post-intervention responses were assessed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and descriptive statistics. A path analysis assessed the influence of anthropogenicity, personal impact, and human efficacy beliefs on participant motivation for action. Multi-regression analyses and descriptive statics were used to evaluate the role of worldview on participant motivation for climate action. RESULTS: Personal motivation for action significantly increased post-intervention. Anthropogenicity, personal impact, and human efficacy beliefs were predictive of personal motivation. Those who prioritized climate change as a safety issue and those driven by a desire to protect current and future generations had higher levels of personal motivation, post-intervention. Knowledge of climate change increased, psychosocial factors as barriers to climate action decreased, and preferences for personal mitigating actions shifted towards more impactful choices post-intervention. Holding Egalitarian worldviews significantly predicted climate action motivation. CONCLUSION: Presenting climate change and climate action strategies via a traditional health and safety risk management context was effective in increasing personal motivation for climate action. This study contributes to the literature on climate change communication and climate action motivation.",,pubmed

The search for improved control measures should include studies of risk factors for infection and illness. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for CVL in an endemic locality of the Federal District, Brazil, from June 2016 to December 2018. Biologic samples and data on dog characteristics, owner household characteristics, and dog care were collected. A combination of serological and molecular tests was used to identify infected animals. The 248 dogs screened for inclusion were predominantly asymptomatic/oligosymptomatic. The baseline prevalence of infection was 27.5%. One hundred six of 162 susceptible dogs were monitored for an average period of 10.7 months. The estimated CVL incidence was 1.91 cases/100 dog-months. The multivariate analysis using a proportional Cox model included the potential risk factors, with P </= 0.25 in the univariate analyses. Greater purchasing power (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06; P = 0.03) and paved yard (HR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.13-1.01; P = 0.05) remained in the final model as risk and protection factors, respectively. The use of repellent collars in dogs was associated moderately (P = 0.08) with protection against CVL. Our findings reflect the challenge of identifying strong interventions for reducing CVL incidence. Increased owner wealth had a counterintuitive effect on CVL, making the intervention scenario more complex for a zoonosis traditionally associated with poverty.",,pubmed

Stimulant use is linked to mental health yet there is limited data from youth in community-based settings. DESIGN: One hundred marginally housed or homeless transitional age youth (TAY) were recruited at Larkin Street Youth Services and completed a survey on mental health and substance use. METHODS: We conducted secondary data analysis using multivariable logistic regression models to identify the correlates of methamphetamine use among TAY. RESULTS: The participants' mean age was 22. Of those who reported methamphetamine use in the past 3 months, 64% were Gay, Bisexual, or Pansexual. Factors independently associated with methamphetamine use were; living with HIV (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.18, 95% CI = 1.11-9.15), depressive symptoms (aOR = 6.02, 95% CI = 1.46-24.78), symptoms of PTSD (aOR = 13.38, 95% CI = 1.59-112.73), polysubstance use in the past 3 months (aOR = 50.02, 95% CI = 9.72-257.46) and a history of injection drug use (aOR = 8.38, 95% CI = 1.87-37.53). CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study suggest a need to develop, adapt, and rapidly implement comprehensive interventions that address the combined epidemics of substance use, HIV, and mental health among TAY. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This article examines factors associated with methamphetamine use among transitional age youth (TAY) experiencing homelessness or housing instability. Several factors were associated with use, including depression, PTSD, HIV status, polysubstance use, and injection drug use. These findings highlight the need for nurses to assess for methamphetamine use among youth as well as associated mental health and physical health problems. Nurses should link TAY who are using methamphetamine to evidence-based treatment programs to address substance use and comorbid conditions.",,pubmed

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the risk factors of TB and incorporate these factors to forecast the incidence of TB infection across different age groups in Sichuan, China. METHODS: Correlation and linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the relationships between TB cases and ecological factors, including environmental, economic, and social factors, in Sichuan Province from 2006 to 2017. The transfer function-noise model was used to forecast trends, considering both time and multifactor effects. RESULTS: From 2006 to 2017, Sichuan Province had a reported cumulative incidence rate of 1321.08 cases per 100,000 individuals in male patients and 583.04 cases per 100,000 individuals in female patients. There were significant sex differences in the distribution of cases among age groups (trend chi(2)(25)=12,544.4; P<.001). Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture had the highest incidence rates of TB in both male and female patients in Sichuan. Correlation and regression analyses showed that the total illiteracy rate and average pressure at each measuring station (for individuals aged 15-24 years) were risk factors for TB. The protective factors were as follows: the number of families with the minimum living standard guarantee in urban areas, the average wind speed, the number of discharged patients with invasive TB, the number of people with the minimum living standard guarantee in rural areas, the total health expenditure as a percentage of regional gross domestic product, and being a single male individual (for those aged 0-14 years); the number of hospitals and number of health workers in infectious disease hospitals (for individuals aged 25-64 years); and the amount of daily morning and evening exercise, the number of people with the urban minimum living standard guarantee, and being married (for female individuals aged >/=65 years). The transfer function-noise model indicated that the incidence of TB in male patients aged 0-14 and 15-24 years will continue to increase, and the incidence of TB in female patients aged 0-14 and >/=65 years will continue to increase rapidly in Sichuan by 2035. CONCLUSIONS: The End TB Strategy in Sichuan should consider environmental, educational, medical, social, personal, and other conditions, and further substantial efforts are needed especially for male patients aged 0-24 years, female patients aged 0-14 years, and female patients older than 64 years.",,pubmed

Methods: A total of 2 250 treated PWH from the Comparative HIV and Aging Research in Taizhou (CHART) were recruited in Taizhou, Zhejiang province. The Chinese version of the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and the International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS) were used to evaluate their neurocognitive performance. Cluster analysis was conducted on the seven cognitive domains in the scale. Results: Among 2 250 treated PWH, 48.0% (1 080/2 250) were aged 45 to 89, 79.2% (1 782/2 250) were male, and 37.8% (852/2 250) had primary school education or below. The prevalence of neurocognitive impairment judged by MMSE and IHDS among HIV-infected people was 14.3% (321/2 250) and 31.8% (716/2 250), respectively. Aged 60 to 89 (aOR=2.63, 95%CI:1.52-4.56), depressive symptoms (aOR=5.58, 95%CI:4.20-7.40) and treatment with EFV (aOR=2.86, 95%CI:1.89-4.34) were main risk factors of NCI diagnosed by MMSE. Male (aOR=0.71, 95%CI:0.51-1.00), overweight (aOR=0.63, 95%CI:0.44-0.89), and high education level (aOR=0.11, 95%CI:0.05-0.25) were protective factors of NCI diagnosed by MMSE. Aged 60 to 89 (aOR=3.10, 95%CI:2.09-4.59), depressive symptoms (aOR=1.78, 95%CI:1.44-2.20) and treatment with EFV (aOR=1.79, 95%CI:1.41-2.29) were risk factors of NCI diagnosed by IHDS. Male (aOR=0.75, 95%CI:0.58-0.97), underweight (aOR=0.67, 95%CI:0.47-0.96), baseline CD4(+) T lymphocyte (CD4) counts >/=350 cells/mul (aOR=0.69, 95%CI:0.53-0.91) and high education level (aOR=0.23, 95%CI:0.14-0.39) were protective factors of NCI diagnosed by IHDS. The neurocognitive performance of HIV-infected people can be divided into four main types. Among four types, age, gender, education level, alcohol drinking, depressive symptoms, waist-to-hip ratio, hypertension, diabetes, baseline CD4 counts and treatment with EFV were different statistically (all P<0.05). Conclusions: There are four main types of neurocognitive performance in treated PWH. The prevalence of NCI is high among this population, underscoring the need for tailored prevention and intervention.",,pubmed

It has been evaluated mainly in middle-aged persons with HIV (PWH). The French multicenter prospective ANRS EP66 SEPTAVIH study aimed to assess frailty prevalence and risk factors in PWH aged 70 years or older on antiretroviral treatment (ART) for at least 12 months. METHODS: At baseline, Fried frailty phenotype criteria, sociodemographic data, medical/HIV history, functional status, comorbidities, including impaired cognitive function, depression, history of falls, and co-medications were collected. We measured the prevalence of frailty and compared the characteristics of frail versus prefrail and robust participants using univariate (Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables and Chi 2 tests for categorical variables) and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Five hundred and ten PWH, mostly male (81.4%), were included with a median age of 73 years. The median HIV and ART durations were 22.7 years and 15.7 years, respectively. The prevalence of frailty was 13.5%, and of prefrailty 63.3%. In the multivariate analysis, increasing age [odds ratio (OR) 1.79 for each 5-year increment; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32-2.41], deprived socioeconomic status (OR 3.17; 95% CI 1.76-5.70), and multimorbidities (three or more) (OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.06-3.90) were associated with frailty. CONCLUSION: A low prevalence of frailty was reported (13.5%) in PWH aged 70 years or older, whereas two-thirds of them were prefrail. Age, low socioeconomic status, and multimorbidities, but no HIV-related factors, were associated with frailty, suggesting the need to target these factors to help promoting successful aging in this population.",,pubmed

A paucity of data and reliance on hospital-based studies from low-income countries make it difficult to quantify the true burden of LBW and PB, the leading cause of neonatal and under-five mortality. We aimed to determine the incidence and risk factors for LBW and preterm birth in Lira district of Northern Uganda. METHODS: This was a community-based cohort study, nested within a cluster-randomized trial, designed to study the effect of a combined intervention on facility-based births. In total, 1877 pregnant women were recruited into the trial and followed from 28 weeks of gestation until birth. Infants of 1556 of these women had their birthweight recorded and 1279 infants were assessed for preterm birth using a maturity rating, the New Ballard Scoring system. Low birthweight was defined as birthweight <2.5kg and preterm birth was defined as birth before 37 completed weeks of gestation. The risk factors for low birthweight and preterm birth were analysed using a multivariable generalized estimation equation for the Poisson family. RESULTS: The incidence of LBW was 121/1556 or 7.3% (95% Confidence interval (CI): 5.4-9.6%). The incidence of preterm births was 53/1279 or 5.0% (95% CI: 3.2-7.7%). Risk factors for LBW were maternal age >/=35 years (adjusted Risk Ratio or aRR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.4), history of a small newborn (aRR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2-3.7), and maternal malaria in pregnancy (aRR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.01-2.9). Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) for malaria, on the other hand, was associated with a reduced risk of LBW (aRR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4-0.8). Risk factors for preterm birth were maternal HIV infection (aRR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.1-7.3), while maternal education for >/=7 years was associated with a reduced risk of preterm birth (aRR: 0.2, 95% CI: 0.1-0.98) in post-conflict northern Uganda. CONCLUSIONS: About 7.3% LBW and 5.0% PB infants were born in the community of post-conflict northern Uganda. Maternal malaria in pregnancy, history of small newborn and age >/=35 years increased the likelihood of LBW while IPT reduced it. Maternal HIV infection was associated with an increased risk of PB compared to HIV negative status. Maternal formal education of >/=7 years was associated with a reduced risk of PB compared to those with 0-6 years. Interventions to prevent LBW and PBs should include girl child education, and promote antenatal screening, prevention and treatment of malaria and HIV infections.",,pubmed

We employed a semi-structured questionnaire based on the literature; it was broken up into sections, and used certain statistical techniques (PLS-SEM) to examine the results. Farmers who had sufficient assets and resources thought they were safer and could withstand the adverse effects of climate change. A total of 900 completed questionnaires were gathered to investigate the link between the control, moderator, and DV variables in the future. As a consequence, the PLS-SEM path analysis findings showed that our model is fit. PLS-SEM direct path analysis revealed AM > FACC, UA- > FACC, SA- > FACC, FS- > FACC, PR- > FACC, and SI- > FACC are significant. The established hypotheses H1-H6 are strengthened by these findings. We also examined the respondents' ages and genders to use as controls; whereas gender showed no correlation with FACC, there was a strong link between age and the dependent variable. There is no statistically significant correlation between gender and climate change awareness, but older people tend to have a broader understanding of the topic and its consequences. Education significantly moderates the relationship of farmer's awareness (climate change) associated with AM, UA, SA, FS, PR, and SI. depicts the moderation role of education on the relationship between AM*Education- > FACC, UA*Education- > FACC, SA*Education- > FACC, FS*Education- > FACC, PR*Education- > FACC, and SI*Education- > FACC.

Our study aimed to evaluate whether being underweight increases the risk of TB using a nationwide representative sample from the Republic of Korea. A large population-based cohort study of over ten million subjects who participated in the health screening in 2010 was performed using the Korean National Health Insurance database 2010-2017. We evaluated the incidence and risk of TB by BMI category (kg/m(2)) for Asians using a multivariable Cox regression model, adjusting for age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, regular exercise, low-income state, and underlying hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. To evaluate the association between BMI and TB risk, the underweight population was further subdivided according to the degree of thinness. During 70,063,154.3 person-years of follow-up, 52,615 of 11,135,332 individuals developed active TB with an incidence of 0.75 per 1000 person-years. Overall, there was a log-linear inverse relationship between TB incidence and BMI, within the BMI range of 15-30 kg/m(2) (R(2) = 0.95). The estimated adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for incident TB in the underweight population (BMI < 18.5) was 2.08 (95% confidence intervals, CI 2.02-2.15), overweight (23 </= BMI < 25) was 0.56 (0.55-0.58) and obese (BMI >/= 25) was 0.40 (0.39-0.41) relative to the normal weight population. Among the underweight population, TB risk increased as the degree of thinness increased (adjusted HR = 1.98, 1.91-2.05; 2.50, 2.33-2.68; and 2.83, 2.55-3.15, for mild, moderate and severe thinness, respectively) (p for trend < 0.001). We found a significant inverse relationship between BMI and TB incidence, which was especially profound in the underweight population.

Fishery workers have a hazardous working environment, leading to specific injuries and fatal events. However, limited studies have investigated the health status of fishery workers through long-term longitudinal follow-up and compared it with that of farmers and employed workers with similar socioeconomic status. Methods: The Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000, a subset of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database was used for this retrospective cohort study. Only fishery workers, farmers, and employed workers were included. Based on the majority of causes of death and related diseases, participants newly diagnosed with 18 diseases, classified into cardiometabolic diseases, mental illness, chronic kidney disease, infection, and malignancy, were included. Participants with an old diagnosis of these diseases were excluded. All included participants were followed up from 1 July 2000 to the diagnosis and withdrawal date, or 31 December 2012, whichever occurred first. Due to the substantial difference in the baseline demographics, we executed a cohort study with propensity score-matched and applied the Cox model to explore the participants' health status. Results: After matching, there were negligible differences in the baseline demographics of fishery workers, farmers, and employed workers. Compared to farmers and employed workers, fishery workers were more frequently diagnosed with 11 and 14 diseases, respectively, such as hypertension (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.11, p < 0.01), diabetes (HR: 1.21, p < 0.001), dyslipidemia (HR: 1.18, p < 0.001), depression (HR: 1.38, p < 0.001), peptic ulcer (HR: 1.17, p < 0.001), chronic viral hepatitis (HR: 2.06, p < 0.001), hepatocellular carcinoma (HR: 1.67, p < 0.001), and total malignancy (HR: 1.26, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Compared to farmers and employed workers, fishery workers were more impacted by cardiometabolic diseases, mental illness, infection, and malignancy. Therefore, it is imperative to specifically focus on health policies for fishery workers, such as providing curable antiviral treatment and initiating culture-tailored health promotion programs, to mitigate health inequality.",,pubmed

Socio-economic inequality has long been thought to contribute to providing an environment for viral propagation. However, identifying socio-economic (SE) risk factors is confounded by intra-urban daily human mobility, with virus being ferried across cities. This study aimed to identify SE variables associated with dengue at a subdistrict level in Bangkok, analyse how they explain observed dengue hotspots and assess the impact of mobility networks on such associations. Using meteorological, dengue case, national statistics, and transport databases from the Bangkok authorities, we applied statistical association and spatial analyses to identify SE variables associated with dengue and spatial hotspots and the extent to which incorporating transport data impacts the observed associations. We identified three SE risk factors at the subdistrict level: lack of education, % of houses being cement/brick, and number of houses as being associated with increased risk of dengue. Spatial hotspots of dengue were found to occur consistently in the centre of the city, but which did not entirely have the socio-economic risk factor characteristics. Incorporation of the intra-urban transport network, however, much improved the overall statistical association of the socio-economic variables with dengue incidence and reconciled the incongruous difference between the spatial hotspots and the SE risk factors. Our study suggests that incorporating transport networks enables a more real-world analysis within urban areas and should enable improvements in the identification of risk factors.",,pubmed

There is growing evidence that DM is an important risk factor for TB. This study was carried out to know the prevalence of DM among newly detected sputum positive pulmonary TB patients registered in District Tuberculosis Centre and to assess the risk factors of DM among TB patients. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, newly detected sputum positive pulmonary TB patients were screened for DM (those having symptoms of DM). Furthermore, they were diagnosed by detecting blood glucose levels (>/=200 mg/dL). Mean, standard deviation (SD), Chi-squared and Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact tests were used to determine the significant associations. P-values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 215 TB patients were included in this study. The prevalence of DM among TB patients was found to be 23.7% (2.8% known and 97.8% new cases). Significant associations were found between age (>46 years old), educational status, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity, presence of DM symptoms and family history of DM. CONCLUSIONS: Routine screening for DM is mandatory due to its increasing prevalence, which may help in early diagnosis and to reduce complications by proper management that in turn helps in the successful outcome of TB treatment.",,pubmed

Experience rating increases the cost of employing workers who have greater medical expenditures, one example being men in same-sex couples. To study whether ESI affects labor market outcomes for men in same-sex couples, I use the 2012 advent of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), a $24,000 per year drug that effectively prevents Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) acquisition. Using American Community Survey data and a difference-in-difference empirical approach - comparing post-PrEP changes in earnings among men who have ESI - I find that annual earnings for men in same-sex couples decline by $2,650 (approximately 3.9%) relative to comparable men after PrEP becomes available. For those who are most likely to be taking Truvada (the brand name for PrEP), such as young men and white men, effects on earnings are considerably larger. I also observe a 3.7 percentage point (4.6%) decline in ESI prevalence and a 0.8 percentage point (10.7%) increase in part-time employment among men in same-sex couples. Event studies provide support for a causal interpretation for my findings. My estimates are also robust to placebo analyses, various specification permutations, and a range of sensitivity checks.",,pubmed

Few CVD-related studies focus on drug use, yet it is common in low-income women living with HIV (WLWH) and increases cardiac dysfunction. SETTING: We recruited unsheltered and unstably housed WLWH from San Francisco community venues to participate in a six-month cohort study investigating linkages between drug use, inflammation, and cardiac dysfunction. METHODS: Adjusting for CVD risk factors, co-infections, medications, and menopause, we examined the effects of toxicology-confirmed drug use and inflammation (C-reactive protein, sCD14, sCD163 and sTNFR2) on levels of NT-proBNP, a biomarker of cardiac stretch and HF. RESULTS: Among 74 WLWH, the median age was 53 years and 45 % were Black. At baseline, 72 % of participants had hypertension. Substances used included tobacco (65 %), cannabis (53 %), cocaine (49 %), methamphetamine (31 %), alcohol (28 %), and opioids (20 %). Factors significantly associated with NT-proBNP included cannabis use (Adjusted Relative Effect [ARE]: -39.6 %) and sTNFR2 (ARE: 65.5 %). Adjusting for heart failure and restricting analyses to virally suppressed persons did not diminish effects appreciably. Cannabis use was not significantly associated with sTNFR2 and did not change the association between sTNFR2 and NT-proBNP. CONCLUSIONS: Among polysubstance-using WLWH, NT-proBNP levels signaling cardiac stretch were positively associated with sTNFR2, but 40 % lower in people who used cannabis. Whether results suggest that cardiovascular pathways associated with cannabis use mitigate cardiac stress and dysfunction independent of inflammation in WLWH who use multiple substances merits further investigation.",,pubmed

These high rates are problematic; therefore, this study attempts to explore the contributing factors that cause high infant and child mortality rates in 14 African countries using panel data for the period of 2000-2018. In particular, the role globalisation is explored. METHODS: The panel corrected standard error (PCSE), the Feasible generalized least square (FGLS) models, and the pair-wise Granger causality test have been applied as methodological approaches. RESULTS: The public health expenditure, numbers of physicians, globalization, economic development, education, good governance, and HIV prevalence rate have been revealed as the determinants of infant and child mortality in these countries. All these variables except the HIV prevalence rate negatively affect the infant and child mortality rates, while the HIV prevalence rate is found to be positive. Bidirectional and unidirectional causal relationships between the variables are also attained. CONCLUSIONS: Effective socio-economic policy priority with due consideration of globalization should be emphasized to reduce infant and child mortality rates in these countries.",,pubmed

Low-income countries are highly affected by Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV). The burden of HIV varies across various segments of the population. The aim of this study was to determine the magnitude of HIV infection and associated factors among female sex workers (FSWs). METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 381 FSWs at Integrated Service on Health and Development Organization (ISHDO) located in Hawassa city from July to November 2018. Socio-demographic and related data were collected using a structured questionnaire. About 5 ml of venous blood was collected from study participants; serum was prepared and tested for HIV using the 4(th) generation Microlisa HIV assay. Data were analyzed by using SPSS version 21; binary and multivariable logistic regressions were used to determine factors associated with HIV infection among FSWs. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The prevalence of HIV among FSWs at ISHDO, Hawassa was 19.9% [95% CI: 16, 24.4].

METHODS: We estimated the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a national cohort of 6738 US adults, enrolled in March-August 2020. Using Poisson models, we examined the association of social distancing and a composite epidemiologic risk score with seroconversion. The risk score was created using least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) regression to identify factors predictive of seroconversion. The selected factors were household crowding, confirmed case in household, indoor dining, gathering with groups of >/=10, and no masking in gyms or salons. RESULTS: Among 4510 individuals with >/=1 serologic test, 323 (7.3% [95% confidence interval (CI), 6.5%-8.1%]) seroconverted by January 2021. Among 3422 participants seronegative in May-September 2020 and retested from November 2020 to January 2021, 161 seroconverted over 1646 person-years of follow-up (9.8 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 8.3-11.5]). The seroincidence rate was lower among women compared with men (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.69 [95% CI, .50-.94]) and higher among Hispanic (2.09 [1.41-3.05]) than white non-Hispanic participants. In adjusted models, participants who reported social distancing with people they did not know (IRR for always vs never social distancing, 0.42 [95% CI, .20-1.0]) and with people they knew (IRR for always vs never, 0.64 [.39-1.06]; IRR for sometimes vs never, 0.60 [.38-.96]) had lower seroconversion risk. Seroconversion risk increased with epidemiologic risk score (IRR for medium vs low score, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.03-2.81]; IRR for high vs low score, 3.49 [2.26-5.58]). Only 29% of those who seroconverted reported isolating, and only 19% were asked about contacts.

A226,"Eviction, intimate partner violence and HIV: Expanding concepts and assessing the pathways through which sexual partnership dynamics impact health.",S0277-9536(22)00336-7,Groves AK; Smith PD; Gebrekristos LT; Keene DE; Rosenberg A; Blankenship KM,2022.0,Social science & medicine (1982),"Over 2 million renters in the United States are legally evicted annually, and even more renters experience other landlord-related forced moves each year. While past research has documented an association between legal eviction and HIV risk, no studies have examined the relationship between forced moves and sexual partnership dynamics longitudinally, or the pathways through which forced moves impact such risk. Addressing this gap is imperative, particularly given inequities that place Black renters and women at disproportionate risk of eviction. This study leverages data from a longitudinal cohort study of 282 adults in New Haven to examine whether landlord-related forced moves reported at baseline (including, but not limited to, legal eviction) is associated with HIV sexual risk reported six months later. We use bootstrapped path analyses to examine intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization and perpetration as potential mediators. One-fifth of participants (21.2%) had experienced a landlord-related forced move at baseline. At follow up, nearly two-thirds (63.8%) reported at least one HIV sexual risk factor, one in seven (14.2%) reported IPV victimization, and one in ten (10.3%) reported IPV perpetration. Individuals who reported landlord-related forced moves were more likely to report IPV victimization (standardized beta = 0.19, SE = 0.08, p = .02) and IPV perpetration (beta = 0.25, SE = 0.09, p = .003). Both IPV victimization and perpetration mediated the association between landlord-related forced moves and HIV sexual risk (indirect victimization effect, beta = 0.09, SE = 0.05, p = .06; indirect perpetration effect, beta = 0.16, SE = 0.07, p = .02), though IPV victimization was only marginally significant. In conclusion, IPV is itself a negative consequence of forced moves that also contributes to other negative health effects, like HIV risk. Therefore, providers should offer violence screening and referral for clients who have recently faced a forced move. Simultaneously, policy-level solutions to prevent eviction and increase housing affordability are urgently needed to address the rising burden - and inequitable distribution - of evictions among low-income renters.",,pubmed

The current incidence of disease exceeds guidelines proposed by the World Health Organisation and United Nations. Whilst the relationship between climate change and TB has surfaced in recent literature, it remains neglected in global agendas. There is a need to acknowledge TB as a climate-sensitive disease to facilitate its eradication. OBJECTIVE: To review epidemiological and prediction model studies that explore how climate change may affect the risk factors for TB, as outlined in the Global Tuberculosis Report 2021: HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, undernutrition, overcrowding, poverty, and indoor air pollution. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases to identify studies examining the association between climate variables and the risk factors for TB. Each study that satisfied the inclusion criteria was assessed for quality and ethics. Studies then underwent vote-counting and were categorised based on whether an association was found. RESULTS: 53 studies met inclusion criteria and were included in our review. Vote-counting revealed that two out of two studies found a positive association between the examined climate change proxy and HIV, nine out of twelve studies for diabetes, eight out of seventeen studies for undernutrition, four out of five studies for overcrowding, twelve out of fifteen studies for poverty and one out of three studies for indoor air pollution. DISCUSSION: We found evidence supporting a positive association between climate change and each of the discussed risk factors for TB, excluding indoor air pollution. Our findings suggest that climate change is likely to affect the susceptibility of individuals to TB by increasing the prevalence of its underlying risk factors, particularly in developing countries. This is an evolving field of research that requires further attention in the scientific community.",,pubmed

In this research, we aimed to: (1) investigate the underlying factor structure of Risk Characteristics (RC), specifically the risk of nosocomial TB transmission in health care facilities; (2) estimate the effects of work-related determinants and RC on risk perception; and (3) compare occupational risk perception of contracting TB with expert risk assessment. METHOD: A paper-based questionnaire was administered to 179 health care workers (HCWs) working at 10 public health centres and two hospitals in Surabaya, Indonesia. We analysed our data using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to unravel the latent structure of RC and structural equation modelling (SEM) to identify determinants of risk perceptions. RESULTS: EFA revealed a two-factor solution for nine qualitative RC: controllability of damage and knowledge-evoked dread. Our SEM analysis found evidence that the controllability aspect of the TB risk was a more profound determinant in predicting risk perception than knowledge-evoked dread, implying that HCWs might benefit from training aims to increase their beliefs on the controllability of TB risk despite its severity. CONCLUSION: Although further research is necessary, our study highlights the importance of addressing occupational risk perceptions in health facilities, encouraging HCWs to become more active in advocating for the necessary allocation of resources for their workplaces, and raising communities' awareness of TB transmissions.",,pubmed

Several risks of violence related to male sexual partners' perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV) following the disclosure of their female intimate partners' HIV + status have been reported. No research has been conducted on male sexual partner's perspectives of perpetrating IPV following their female intimate partners' disclosure of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive status as a risk factor for the perpetration of IPV in Ghana. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to explore and describe male sexual partners' views or perspectives of perpetrating IPV following their female intimate partners' disclosure of being HIV positive in Ghana. METHODS: Interpretive phenomenological approach was used to collect and analyse data from a purposive sample of 18 Male participants whose female intimate relations informed them of being HIV + in Ghana. The sample population was taken from Ghana because such research has been reported elsewhere but none has been done in Ghana. A semi-structured interview guide was used to collect the data. The interview guide covered topics such as background information, participants' reaction to HIV positive disclosure, lived experiences of participants, and Participants' understanding of different forms of IPV. RESULTS: The findings of this study reveal five main themes that emerged from the interviews which include views on the perpetration of emotional, psychological, and verbal abuse; views on the perpetration of sexual deprivation; views on the perpetration of social isolation; views on the perpetration of financial abuse and views on escalated perpetration of physical abuse. CONCLUSION: From the data, HIV positive status disclosure served as a risk factor for different forms of GB IPV against HIV positive women in Ghana, thus making this group more vulnerable and exposed to more GB IPV. Strategies to prevent the perpetration of IPV against women newly diagnosed as HIV positive are needed. We recommend screening all newly diagnosed HIV-positive women for abuse as an additional prevention strategy for IPV associated with disclosure of positive HIV status.

We included data 13,469 and 5682 South African women who participated to South African HIV behavioural surveys in 2002-2012 and 2017, respectively. HIV prevalence and incidence rates were significantly higher among single/not-cohabiting women compared to those married/cohabiting with a partner in all survey participants (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.60 and 1.58 in 2002-2012 and 2017, respectively). A quarter of the HIV diagnoses were attributed to those who were single/not-cohabiting women (population attributable risk (PAR%): 25% and 24%, respectively). More than 40% of the HIV infections were exclusively associated with single women (PAR%: 42%, 95% CI: 33%, 51%).

We found direct pathways from gender (boys vs. girls) and from dating relationship (dating vs. not) to condom determinant. Sexting-based condom negotiation partially mediated the pathway from gender/dating relationship to condom determinant, and fully mediated the pathways from gender/dating relationship to condom practices. Future digital sexual health interventions should consider the utility of texting-based applications in promoting knowledge and use of condoms among adolescents.",,pubmed

Understanding specific risk factors for SI and SA among PLWH will help with developing tailored and effective suicide prevention strategies among this high-risk group. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2020 to April 2021 in Baoji municipality, Shaanxi Province. The PLWH registered with the Baoji Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were recruited and interviewed. Questionnaires and interviews for this study consisted of socio-demographic variables, mental health history, and psychosocial characteristics. The HIV-related clinical features were obtained from CDC medical records. The PLWH included were divided into three groups, i.e., those with a history of suicide attempts (SA group), those with suicidal ideation only (SI group), and those without any suicidal behavior (NSB group). Multinomial logistic regression was used for three-way comparisons among these three groups of PLWH. RESULTS: In total, 995 PLWH were interviewed. The prevalence of probable depression, probable anxiety, SI, and SA in PLWH after being diagnosed as HIV+ was 18.6%, 13.5%, 26.7%, and 3.2%, respectively. Compared with the NSB group, the SI or SA groups were more likely to report probable depression [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.43, 4.44, respectively], probable anxiety (AOR = 2.80, 5.62, respectively), and high HIV-related stigma (AOR = 2.05, 2.65, respectively). The SI group was more likely to experience high HIV-related stress (AOR = 1.91) and lower quality of life (AOR = 0.56) than the NSB group. Social support and HIV-related clinical features were not associated with SI or SA in this sample. The SA group did not differ from the SI group on any of the psychosocial or HIV-related clinical features. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health problems are serious in community residents identified with having an HIV infection in a Central West China municipality. It is important to deliver low-cost and effective psychological services tailored for PLWH that are focused on reducing mental health problems. Future studies should utilize sensitive screening measures and further clarify factors potentially associated with the transition from SI to SA in PLWH.",,pubmed

We aimed to estimate the impact of post-tuberculosis (post-TB) on pulmonary function. METHODS: This large cross-sectional, population-based study included subjects aged 15 years or older with technically acceptable postbronchodilator spirometry measurements. Post-TB was diagnosed on the basis of radiological evidence and/or medical history. Airflow obstruction was defined as a postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity ratio below the lower limit of normal of Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) lung function equations. Small airway dysfunction was diagnosed if at least two of the following indicators were less than 65% of predicted: maximal mid-expiratory flow, forced expiratory flow (FEF) 50% or FEF 75%. RESULTS: In this population sample (N=8680, mean age: 40.1 years), 610 (7.0% (95% CI 6.5 to 7.6) participants were post-TB. Post-TB subjects had more frequent respiratory symptoms (46.8% vs 28.3%). Among post-TB subjects, 130 (21.3% (95% CI 18.1 to 24.8)) had airflow obstruction; OR of airflow obstruction was significantly associated with post-TB after adjustment for other confounding factors (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.62). Post-TB was also associated with small airway dysfunction (OR 1.28, 95% CI1.07 to 1.53), which was present in 297 (48.9% (95% CI 33.9 to 53.0)) post-TB subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support existing knowledge that post-TB is positively associated with pulmonary function impairment and make for frequent respiratory symptoms. Post-TB should be considered as a potentially important cause of airflow obstruction and respiratory symptoms in patients originating from countries with a high burden of tuberculosis.",,pubmed

Little is known about genotype-specific HPV prevalence, the impact of antiretroviral therapy, immunological status, and additional risk factors in women living with HIV in Germany. The goal of this study was to characterize the risk profile for cervical dysplasia in these women. METHODS: Patients with HIV infection presenting at Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin from October 2017 to September 2020 were included and underwent gynecological examination, colposcopy, cervical cytology and HPV genotype testing. HPV genotypes were stratified by carcinogenicity. Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or higher were considered abnormal cytology. Data were analyzed by SPSS software (version 26, 2019). A two-tailed p-value </=0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 84 women were evaluated. The majority (95.2%) received antiretroviral therapy. Median CD4 cell count was 564 cells/microl (range 20-1969). 95.2% were previously screened for cervical cancer. High-risk HPV prevalence was 44%. High-high-risk HPV subtypes (16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58) were significantly associated with abnormal cytology (p<0.001). HPV16 was the most common genotype (23%), was significantly associated with abnormal cytology (p=0.002) and was the main risk factor for abnormal cytology (OR 8.55, 95% CI 2.15 to 34.13, p=0.002), followed by age <35 years (OR 4.96, 95% CI 1.23 to 19.61, p=0.033) and cigarette smoking (OR 3.944, 95% CI 0.98 to 15.88, p=0.053). CONCLUSIONS: Antiretroviral therapy and adherence to cervical cancer screening was high. High-high-risk HPV, especially HPV16, coincided with high incidence of cytological abnormalities. Women living with HIV in Germany have adequate immune status and are often pre-screened for cervical cancer, and therefore have a different risk profile for cervical dysplasia than in low-income or medium-income countries. Adapted screening programs should be defined.",,pubmed

Additionally, social determinants and socioeconomic deprivation have since long been associated with worse health and perceived as important risk factors for TB. This study aimed to analyze the spatial distribution of non-MDR-TB and MDR-TB across parishes of the Lisbon metropolitan area of Portugal and to estimate the association between non-MDR-TB and MDR-TB and socioeconomic deprivation. METHODS: In this study, we used hierarchical Bayesian spatial models to analyze the spatial distribution of notification of non-MDR-TB and MDR-TB cases for the period from 2000 to 2016 across 127 parishes of the seven municipalities of the Lisbon metropolitan area (Almada, Amadora, Lisboa, Loures, Odivelas, Oeiras, Sintra), using the Portuguese TB Surveillance System (SVIG-TB). In order to characterise the populations, we used the European Deprivation Index for Portugal (EDI-PT) as an indicator of poverty and estimated the association between non-MDR-TB and MDR-TB and socioeconomic deprivation. RESULTS: The notification rates per 10,000 population of non-MDR TB ranged from 18.95 to 217.49 notifications and that of MDR TB ranged from 0.83 to 3.70. We identified 54 high-risk areas for non-MDR-TB and 13 high-risk areas for MDR-TB. Parishes in the third [relative risk (RR) = 1.281, 95% credible interval (CrI): 1.021-1.606], fourth (RR = 1.786, 95% CrI: 1.420-2.241) and fifth (RR = 1.935, 95% CrI: 1.536-2.438) quintile of socioeconomic deprivation presented higher non-MDR-TB notifications rates. Parishes in the fourth (RR = 2.246, 95% CrI: 1.374-3.684) and fifth (RR = 1.828, 95% CrI: 1.049-3.155) quintile of socioeconomic deprivation also presented higher MDR-TB notifications rates. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated significant heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of both non-MDR-TB and MDR-TB at the parish level and we found that socioeconomically disadvantaged parishes are disproportionally affected by both non-MDR-TB and MDR-TB. Our findings suggest that the emergence of MDR-TB and transmission are specific from each location and often different from the non-MDR-TB settings. We identified priority areas for intervention for a more efficient plan of control and prevention of non-MDR-TB and MDR-TB.",,pubmed
A236,Greenhouse gas emission widens income inequality in Africa.,10.1007/s11356-022-18925-5,Ashenafi BB,2022.0,Environmental science and pollution research international,"Over the past couple of decades, the world has witnessed a rise in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and rising income inequality that threatens human well-being. Addressing these challenges and ensuring sustainable development become a pressing issue for policymakers. This paper investigates the impact of GHG emissions on income inequality in Africa. The study uses a panel data set from 49 countries from 1981 to 2015 and shows that GHG emission widens income inequality. The result is robust for alternative emission indicators. A direct implication is that climate change policy should be designed to narrow income inequality. It is emphasized that mitigation actions should focus on the agriculture sector. Hence, intervention towards energy-smart agriculture, land conservation practices, exploiting the job creation potential, and strengthening value addition in the agricultural sector is decisive. Reforming agriculture reduces emission, narrows income inequality, and realizes sustainable development on the continent.",,pubmed

Many estimates of STH infection are often based on school-aged children (SAC). This study produced predictive risk-maps of STH on a more finite scale, estimated the number of people infected, and the amount of drug required for preventive chemotherapy (PC) in Ogun state, Nigeria. Georeferenced STH infection data obtained from a cross-sectional survey at 33 locations between July 2016 and November 2018, together with remotely-sensed environmental and socio-economic data were analyzed using Bayesian geostatistical modelling. Stepwise variable selection procedure was employed to select a parsimonious set of predictors to predict risk and spatial distribution of STH infections. The number of persons (pre-school ages children, SAC and adults) infected with STH were estimated, with the amount of tablets needed for preventive chemotherapy. An overall prevalence of 17.2% (95% CI 14.9, 19.5) was recorded for any STH infection. Ascaris lumbricoides infections was the most predominant, with an overall prevalence of 13.6% (95% CI 11.5, 15.7), while Hookworm and Trichuris trichiura had overall prevalence of 4.6% (95% CI 3.3, 5.9) and 1.7% (95% CI 0.9, 2.4), respectively. The model-based prevalence predictions ranged from 5.0 to 23.8% for Ascaris lumbricoides, from 2.0 to 14.5% for hookworms, and from 0.1 to 5.7% for Trichuris trichiura across the implementation units. The predictive maps revealed a spatial pattern of high risk in the central, western and on the border of Republic of Benin. The model identified soil pH, soil moisture and elevation as the main predictors of infection for A. lumbricoides, Hookworms and T. trichiura respectively. About 50% (10/20) of the implementation units require biannual rounds of mass drug administration. Approximately, a total of 1.1 million persons were infected and require 7.8 million doses. However, a sub-total of 375,374 SAC were estimated to be infected, requiring 2.7 million doses. Our predictive risk maps and estimated PC needs provide useful information for the elimination of STH, either for resource acquisition or identifying priority areas for delivery of interventions in Ogun State, Nigeria.",,pubmed

HIV,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about suicide mortality among people with HIV in low-income and middle-income countries. This study aimed to assess suicide mortality and its temporal change among people with HIV after diagnosis, then describe potential risk factors. METHODS: This nationwide, population-based cohort study used data from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP), which continually enrolled people diagnosed with HIV in mainland China. We included all people with HIV diagnosed between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2018, who were aged 15 years or older at diagnosis. Follow-up started from the date of HIV diagnosis to the date of death, date of last follow-up visit, or Dec 31, 2018, whichever came first. Crude suicide mortality was calculated as the number of suicide deaths divided by person-years at risk in 2012-18 and compared by time after HIV diagnosis. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were used to compare the relative risk of suicide deaths in people with HIV with the general population. We compared the trends of suicide mortality across three diagnosis year groups (2012-13, 2014-15, and 2016-18) using cumulative incidence curve of suicide. Competing-risk models were used to explore the potential risk factors of suicide. FINDINGS: 770 656 people diagnosed with HIV were included in the CISDCP database, 763 287 of whom were aged 15 years or older at diagnosis and had follow-up information available. During follow-up, 2825 (2.0%) of 144 729 all-cause deaths were due to suicide, with a mortality of 142.8 deaths by suicide per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 137.7-148.2). People with HIV were at an increased risk of suicide compared with the general population (SMR 20.9 [95% CI 20.2-21.7]). The greatest risk was during the first 3 months after diagnosis (SMR 98.1 [93.1-103.4]), which then decreased but was still elevated after the first year (SMR 9.2 [8.5-9.8]). Late diagnosis and never on antiretroviral therapy were independent risk factors for suicide. INTERPRETATION: Suicide mortality decreased during the study period, which coincided with improvement in access to care and treatment coverage. This study suggests the importance of targeted suicide prevention for people with HIV throughout the course of diagnosis and that the focus of efforts should be concentrated on the first 3 months after diagnosis. Our findings highlight the urgent need to integrate suicide screening and prevention in HIV care.

Our goal was to describe TB-related deaths and to identify associated risk factors.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in two hospitals in Paris between 2013 and 2018. All patients with drug-susceptible TB were included and followed until end of treatment. The primary outcome was death. We performed univariate and multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazard model.RESULTS: Of the 523 patients included, 362 were men (median age 37 years), of whom 24 patients died (4.5%). The final survival model concluded that age (HR 1.1 for each additional year), not living in one s own accommodation (HR 5.9), being born in France (HR 8.0), being alcoholic (HR 4.2), having a history of cancer (HR 7.1) or meningeal or miliary TB (HR 8.2) were associated with a higher risk of death.CONCLUSION: The rate of TB-associated death is unacceptably high for a curable disease. To note, patients born in France were much more at risk of death than immigrants. We believe raising awareness among healthcare professionals is a potentially easy and efficient lever for improving care.",,pubmed

With the implementation of AIDS prevention projects and the continuous maturity of technology, more and more HIV-positive women choose to have children. However, the children born to these women are a special group. Exposure to HIV and antiviral drugs during the fetal period can increase the success rate of children's elimination of the mother, which is worthy of attention and research. This article focuses on the analysis of the related factors of mother-to-child transmission of AIDS and the evaluation of mother-to-child blocking measures, using the method of field research to conduct experiments on AIDS patients in this city who are pregnant and provide them with antidrug treatment and some barrier measures. Then, the mother-to-child transmission rate was recorded, and the experimental results showed that the antidrug treatment plan is related to mother-to-child transmission. After antidrug treatment, the transmission rate of single-drug treatment is reduced by 5%, and the transmission rate of combined drug treatment is reduced by 10%. It can be seen from this that antidrug treatment is an effective measure to block mothers and babies.",,pubmed

We evaluated the impact of a livelihood intervention on the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) of young people in the slum areas of Kampala, Uganda. We carried out a repeated cross-sectional survey in 2014 and 2017 to examine the impact of community-based livelihood interventions on the SRHR of young people in the slum areas of Kampala, Uganda. Impacts were observed such as reduced sexual activity, reduction in aspects of gender-based violence attitudes and beliefs, increased access to and decision-making about contraceptive and family-planning services, increased availability and affordability of SRHR services, reduced need to seek further knowledge on SRHR, reduced barriers to HIV testing, and increased knowledge of health responsibilities. Unexpected results included: increased proportion of young people who had ever had sex, decreased mean age of sexual debut, unaffordability of contraceptives, and increased culturally shaped attitudes and social norms related to gender-based violence. We observed no impact on condom use, consensual sex and sexual assault, the number of sexual partners, knowledge about HIV/AIDS, stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS, affordability of male and female condoms, and uptake of HIV testing services. Rights-based interventions are crucial to how we understand the SRHR of young people in complex sociocultural environments. While the livelihood interventions made significant impacts on the SRHR of young people, there are questions about how such interventions address deeply rooted sociocultural practices to maximise outcomes.",,pubmed

In this study, the focus is primarily on environmental health risks for TB, particularly on those associated with sociodemographic and household living conditions in South Africa.METHODS: Data for this study were collected between 2014 and 2019 from a number of sites implementing community-oriented primary care (COPC) in the Gauteng Province of the country. Community health workers (CHWs) used AitaHealth(tm), a custom-built mobile information management application, to obtain data on the TB status and environmental conditions of households. Statistical models were used to determine associations between various demographic, socio-economic and environmental risk factors, and TB.RESULTS: Approximately 12,503 TB cases were reported among 7,769 households. Substance use and male-headed households were found to have significant associations in households with at least one individual with TB. Overcrowding, as well as lack of access to piped water and adequate sanitation were also found to be positively associated with a 'TB-household.

METHODS: A qualitative study was carried out during January-April 2020 among twenty-two pulmonary TB patients, recorded as LTFU in NIKSHAY, with ten treatment supporters and ten patient's family members. Semi-structured personal interview tools were used to collect the information on the history of anti-tuberculosis treatment, adverse drug events (ADE), social cognitive, behaviors, myths, and misbeliefs. The interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed to examine underlying themes. RESULTS: The study explored various social, behavioral factors leading to loss to follow-up among PTB patients. Drug side effects, alcoholism, social stigma, lack of awareness of the seriousness of the diseases and poor counseling are the main barriers to treatment adherence in this community. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the need to address the issues related to LTFU during TB treatment.

Eleven percent (11%) of these deaths occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where malaria continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Children are amongst the most vulnerable to malaria, which causes 40% of childhood deaths in the country. Although many risk factors for developing malaria have been identified, there is a paucity of data available on the sociodemographic risk factors for pediatric malaria. A cross-sectional study including 131 febrile children aged 2 months to 14 years presenting to Heal Africa Hospital due to febrile illness. Guardians of participants answered a questionnaire about household and maternal characteristics, as well as child symptomatology. Malaria status was confirmed via blood smear. Results were analyzed using the chi-square test, likelihood ratios and a logistic regression. The absence of father as head of household (p=0.011) and gestational malaria (p=0.044) were significantly associated with pediatric malaria. This study provides insight into sociodemographic risk factors associated with pediatric malaria in the DRC. While further investigation is required, this study highlights the benefit of considering these factors when approaching the febrile child. A pediatric malaria assessment tool incorporating socio-demographics, symptoms and physical exam findings may guide investigations to reduce unnecessary testing and provide better patient-centred care.",,pubmed

METHODS: Socio-demographic and behavioural information from residents (aged 1-69 years) of households were collected through pre-tested, questionnaire conducted in 2018 and 2019. Blood samples collected from participants were tested for Plasmodium falciparum and/or Plasmodium vivax infection using rapid diagnostic test, microscopy and PCR. Plasma samples from a subset of participants were analysed for antibodies against thirteen P. falciparum and four P. vivax antigens. Associations between household and individual level risk factors, and Plasmodium infections were evaluated using multilevel logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 2753 individuals from 827 households were enrolled in 2018, and 834 individuals from 222 households were enrolled in 2019. Of them, 33 (1.2%) were positive by PCR for P. falciparum in 2018 and none were positive for P. vivax. In 2019, no PCR-positive individuals were detected. All, but one, infections were asymptomatic; all 33 infections were sub-microscopic. Reported history of malaria in the past 12 months (OR = 8.84) and history of travel in the past 14 days (OR = 10.06) were significantly associated with Plasmodium infection. A significant trend of increased seropositivity with age was noted for all 17 antigens. Although adults (>/= 18 years) consistently had the highest seropositivity rates, a sizeable proportion of under-five children were also found to be seropositive. Almost all individuals (99.4%) reported sleeping under an insecticide-treated bed-net, and household indoor residual spray coverage in the 12 months preceding the survey was low (23%). Most participants correctly identified common signs and symptoms of malaria, i.e., fever (96.4%), headache (71.2%), chills (83.2%) and body-ache (61.8%). Almost all participants (94.3%) used government-provided services for treatment of malaria. CONCLUSION: This study explored the epidemiology of malaria in two communities in Meghalaya, India, in the context of declining transmission. The presence of widespread asymptomatic infections and seropositivity among under-five children suggest that low-level Plasmodium transmission persists in this region.

Household socioeconomic factors are known to influence these conditions. However, it is not clear how these factors influence malaria transmission and anemia in Masasi and Nanyumbu Districts. This study presents findings on malaria and anemia situation in under-five children and its influencing socioeconomic factors in Masasi and Nanyumbu Districts, surveyed as part of an ongoing seasonal malaria chemoprevention operational study. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between August and September 2020. Finger-prick blood samples collected from children aged 3-59 months were used to test for malaria infection using malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT), thick smears for determination of asexual and sexual parasitemia, and thin smear for parasite speciation. Hemoglobin concentration was measured using a HemoCue spectrophotometer. A structured questionnaire was used to collect household socioeconomic information from parents/caregivers of screened children. The prevalence of malaria was the primary outcome. Chi-square tests, t-tests, and logistic regression models were used appropriately. RESULTS: Overall mRDT-based malaria prevalence was 15.9% (373/2340), and was significantly higher in Nanyumbu (23.7% (167/705) than Masasi District (12.6% (206/1635), p<0.001. Location (Nanyumbu), no formal education, household number of people, household number of under-fives, not having a bed net, thatched roof, open/partially open eave, sand/soil floor, and low socioeconomic status were major risks for malaria infection. Some 53.9% (1196/2218) children had anemia, and the majority were in Nanyumbu (63.5% (458/705), p<0.001. Location (Nanyumbu), mRDT positive, not owning a bed net, not sleeping under bed net, open/partially open eave, thatched window, sex of the child, and age of the child were major risk factors for anemia.

In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), information on the burden of S. mansoni infection is scarce, which hinders the implementation of adequate control measures. We assessed the geographical distribution of S. mansoni infection across Ituri province in north-eastern DRC and determined the prevailing risk factors. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Two province-wide, community-based studies were conducted. In 2016, a geographical distribution study was carried out in 46 randomly selected villages across Ituri. In 2017, an in-depth study was conducted in 12 purposively-selected villages, across the province. Households were randomly selected, and members were enrolled. In 2016, one stool sample was collected per participant, while in 2017, several samples were collected per participant. S. mansoni eggs were detected using the Kato-Katz technique. In 2017, a point-of-care circulating cathodic S. mansoni antigen (POC-CCA) urine test was the second used diagnostic approach. Household and individual questionnaires were used to collect data on demographic, socioeconomic, environmental, behavioural and knowledge risk factors. Of the 2,131 participants in 2016, 40.0% were positive of S. mansoni infection. Infection prevalence in the villages ranged from 0 to 90.2%. Of the 707 participants in 2017, 73.1% were tested positive for S. mansoni. Prevalence ranged from 52.8 to 95.0% across the health districts visited. Infection prevalence increased from north to south and from west to east. Exposure to the waters of Lake Albert and the villages' altitude above sea level were associated with the distribution. Infection prevalence and intensity peaked in the age groups between 10 and 29 years. Preschool children were highly infected (62.3%). Key risk factors were poor housing structure (odds ratio [OR] 2.1, 95% 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-4.35), close proximity to water bodies (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.1-2.49), long-term residence in a community (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.11-1.79), lack of latrine in the household (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.11-3.60), and swimming (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.20-5.32) and washing (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.10-2.78) in local water bodies. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show that S. mansoni is highly endemic and a major health concern in Ituri province, DRC. Infection prevalence and intensity, and the prevailing socioeconomic, environmental, and behavioural risk factors in Ituri reflect intense exposure and alarming transmission rates.

We sought to study the association between previous tuberculosis disease and COPD by using pooled population-based cross-sectional data in 13 geographically diverse, low-resource settings. METHODS: We pooled six cohorts in 13 different LMIC settings, 6 countries and 3 continents to study the relationship between self-reported previous tuberculosis disease and lung function outcomes including COPD (defined as a postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1))/forced vital capacity (FVC) below the lower limit of normal). Multivariable regressions with random effects were used to examine the association between previous tuberculosis disease and lung function outcomes. RESULTS: We analysed data for 12 396 participants (median age 54.0 years, 51.5% male); 332 (2.7%) of the participants had previous tuberculosis disease. Overall prevalence of COPD was 8.8% (range 1.7%-15.5% across sites). COPD was four times more common among those with previous tuberculosis disease (25.7% vs 8.3% without previous tuberculosis disease, p<0.001). The adjusted odds of having COPD was 3.78 times higher (95% CI 2.87 to 4.98) for participants with previous tuberculosis disease than those without a history of tuberculosis disease. The attributable fraction of COPD due to previous tuberculosis disease in the study sample was 6.9% (95% CI 4.8% to 9.6%). Participants with previous tuberculosis disease also had lower prebronchodilator Z-scores for FEV(1) (-0.70, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.55), FVC (-0.44, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.29) and the FEV(1):FVC ratio (-0.63, 95% CI -0.76 to -0.51) when compared with those without previous tuberculosis disease. CONCLUSIONS: Previous tuberculosis disease is a significant and under-recognised risk factor for COPD and poor lung function in LMICs. Better tuberculosis control will also likely reduce the global burden of COPD.",,pubmed

It is fuelled by gender inequality and disparity, which has resulted in a fundamental violation of women's human rights. This study aims to find out the association of intimate partner violence (IPV) and other risk factors with the prevalence of HIV infection among married women in India. METHODS: This study is based on data from the India National Family Health Survey (2015-16). Bivariate analysis has been performed to estimate the prevalence of HIV. Logistic regression analysis is conducted to find out the association between IPV, factors such as having alcoholic husband and lifetime partner, and HIV infection among currently married women. RESULTS: Married women who had faced physical, sexual, and emotional violence from their husbands/partners were almost twice more likely to have tested HIV positive compared to married women who did not face violence [OR: 2.14, CI: 1.08-4.50]. The odds of testing for HIV positive was significantly higher among the married women experiencing IPV and having alcoholic husband [OR: 4.48, CI: 1.87-10.70] than those who did not experience IPV and had non-alcoholic husband. The use of condom did not show any significant association with HIV infection. Again, having more than one lifetime partner had a positive association with HIV infection compared to those with one partner [OR: 2.45, CI: 1.21-4.16]. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that factors such as experiencing all types of IPV, having an alcoholic husband, increased number of lifetime partners, being sexually inactive, belonging to vulnerable social groups, and urban place of residence are important risk factors of HIV infection among married women in India. The results also suggest that gender-based violence and an alcoholic husband may represent a significant factor of HIV infection among married women and interventions should on focus such vulnerable populations.",,pubmed

Data analysis was guided by a qualitative data analysis framework. The findings showed that cultural practices in Belu related to the use of bride wealth, managing spousal disputes, marriage, and condom use, influenced spousal relationships and sexual behaviours or practices which contributed to HIV transmission. Javanese cultural practices and expectation of an 'ideal wife', Islamic religious beliefs about expected husband-wife relationships, forbidden premarital sex, and the participants' individual interpretation of their religious beliefs about condom use spousal sexual relations, also influenced spousal sexual relations and behaviours, which supported HIV transmission among the participants. The findings indicate the need for HIV education programs that address cultural practices and religious beliefs for community members and population groups to enhance their understanding about HIV, condom use, and how cultural practices and religious beliefs play a role in HIV transmission. The findings also indicate the need for involvement of religious leaders in HIV education programs to bring insights to people and help them interpret their religious beliefs in health promoting ways. Future studies that explore different aspects of culture and religion which may contribute to HIV transmission are recommended.",,pubmed
A253,The Relationship Between Socio-Demographic Factors and Tuberculosis Mortality in the Republic of Korea During 2008-2017.,10.3389/fpubh.2021.691006,Chung S; Seon JY; Lee SH; Kim HY; Lee YW; Bae K; Oh IH,2021.0,Frontiers in public health,"The Republic of Korea has a high incidence of tuberculosis (TB) and TB-specific mortality rate. In 2019, it had the second highest TB-specific mortality among Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. Understanding the factors associated with TB-specific deaths may help eradicate the disease. Therefore, we aimed to identify the general characteristics associated with TB-specific mortality among Koreans. Using Causes of Death Statistics data from Statistics Korea, we assessed the year of death, sex, age, occupation, area of residence, marital status, and education level reported between 2008 and 2017. Patient characteristics associated with TB-specific deaths were analyzed using the Chi-squared test, while influencing factors of TB-specific mortality were analyzed using logistic regression analysis to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AOR). Female (AOR: 0.509, 95% CI: 0.493-0.526), those with a graduate degree or higher (AOR: 0.559, 95% CI: 0.474-0.660) had lower TB-specific mortality rates than those of their counterparts. Conversely, those aged >/=70 years (AOR: 1.239, 95% CI: 1.199-1.280), single (AOR: 1.355, 95% CI: 1.315-1.396), and skilled agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers (AOR: 1.441, 95% CI: 1.359-1.529) had higher TB-specific mortality rates than those of their counterparts. In conclusion, TB-specific mortality rates differed according to the characteristics of the deceased patients. In order to establish effective TB control, multisectoral action on broader determinants should be strengthened.",,pubmed
A254,Schistosoma mansoni infection risk for school-aged children clusters within households and is modified by distance to freshwater bodies.,10.1371/journal.pone.0258915,Lamberti O; Kabatereine NB; Tukahebwa EM; Chami GF,2021.0,PloS one,"BACKGROUND: The interaction of socio-demographic and ecological factors with Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) infection risk by age and the household clustering of infections between individuals are poorly understood. METHODS: This study examined 1,832 individuals aged 5-90 years across 916 households in Mayuge District, Uganda. S. mansoni infection status and intensity were measured using Kato-Katz microscopy. Socio-demographic and ecological factors were examined as predictors of infection status and intensity using logistic and negative binomial regression models, respectively, with standard errors clustered by household. A subgroup analysis of children was conducted to examine the correlation of infection status between children and their caretakers. FINDINGS: Infection varied within age groups based on the distance to Lake Victoria. Children aged 9-17 years and young adults aged 18-29 years who lived </=0.50km from Lake Victoria were more likely to be infected compared to individuals of the same age who lived further away from the lake. Infections clustered within households. Children whose caretakers were heavily infected were 2.67 times more likely to be infected. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate the focality of schistosome transmission and its dependence on socio-demographic, ecological and household factors. Future research should investigate the sampling of households within communities as a means of progressing towards precision mapping of S. mansoni infections.",,pubmed

Guidelines for people living with HIV (PLWH) in low-income countries (LIC) recommend STI testing for symptomatic persons and those newly diagnosed with HIV; routine STI testing is less clear. Here we provide updated syphilis prevalence and identify co-infection risk factors in PLWH in the African Cohort Study (AFRICOS) to understand these rates as they relate to syndromic treatment. METHODS: AFRICOS is a study enrolling PLWH and HIV-uninfected individuals in four African countries. Participant study enrollment information was used to determine syphilis prevalence and co-infection risk factors. Inclusion criteria consisted of adults 18 years or older receiving care at a participating clinic as a long-term resident who consented to data and specimen collection. Exclusion criteria consisted of pregnancy and/or imprisonment. Screen-positive syphilis was defined as a reactive rapid plasma regain (RPR) upon study enrollment whereas confirmed syphilis included a reactive RPR followed by reactive treponemal test. Multivariate analyses was performed to determine HIV and syphilis co-infection risk factors. RESULTS: Between 2013 and March 1, 2020, 2939 PLWH enrolled and 2818 were included for analysis. Screen-positive and confirmed syphilis prevalence were 5.3% (151/2818) and 3.1% (87/2818), respectively. When the analysis was restricted to PLWH with an RPR titer of greater than, or equal to, 1:8, 11/87 (12.6%) participants were included. No PLWH and confirmed syphilis had documented genital ulcers. In the multivariate model, participants with confirmed syphilis co-infection were more likely to have none or some primary education [aOR 3.29 (1.60, 6.74)] and consume alcohol [aOR 1.87 (1.16, 3.03)] compared to those without syphilis. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) with suppressed viral load (VL) was protective in the unadjusted model but not adjusted multivariate model. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that syphilis rates in sub-Saharan Africa remain elevated where diagnosis remains challenging, and that both lower education level and alcohol consumption are significantly associated with HIV/syphilis co-infection in AFRICOS. Based on our analysis, current STI guidelines targeting testing for African individuals with either new HIV diagnosis or syndromic symptoms may be inadequate, highlighting the need for increased testing and treatment strategies in resource-limited settings.",,pubmed

It remains controversial whether this risk persists with antiretroviral therapy. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate whether pregnant women living with HIV and receiving antiretroviral therapy antenatally, are at an increased risk of adverse outcomes compared with HIV-negative controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, EBM Reviews, PubMed (non-MEDLINE records), EBSCO CINAHL Complete, Clarivate Web of Science, African Index Medicus, LILACS and Google Scholar for all observational studies comparing pregnant women living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy with HIV-negative controls from 1 January 1994 to 10 August 2021 with no language or geographic restrictions. Perinatal outcomes included preterm birth (PTB), low birthweight, small-for-gestational age and preeclampsia. Using a random-effects model we pooled raw data to generate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each outcome. Sub-analyses for high and low resource countries and time of antiretroviral therapy initiation were performed. This systematic review and meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42020182722. RESULTS: Of the 7900 citations identified, 27 were eligible for analysis (12 636 pregnant women living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy and 7 812 115 HIV-negative controls). ORs (95% CI) of PTB (1.88 [1.63-2.17]), small-for-gestational age (1.60 [1.18-2.17]) and low birthweight (2.15 [1.58-2.92]) were significantly higher in pregnant women living with HIV than in HIV-negative women, while the risk of preeclampsia (0.86 [0.57-1.30]) was comparable. The risk of PTB and low birthweight was higher in both high resource and low resource countries, while the risk of small-for-gestational age was higher only in the former. Preconceptional antiretroviral therapy was associated with a higher risk of PTB compared with antenatal initiation. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy have an increased risk of PTB, low birthweight and small-for-gestational age in high resource countries, as well as PTB and low birthweight in low income countries compared with HIV-negative controls.",,pubmed

This study estimated the malaria-induced decrease in haemoglobin levels among young children in malaria-endemic Burkina Faso. METHODS: The study was based on pooled individual-level nationally representative health survey data (2010-2011, 2014, 2017-2018) from 17 599 children under 5 years of age. This data was used to estimate the effects of malaria on haemoglobin concentration, controlling for household fixed-effects, age, and sex in a series of regression analyses. The fixed-effects controlled for observed and unobserved confounding on the household level and allowed to determine the impact of malaria infection status on haemoglobin levels and anaemia prevalence. Furthermore, the diagnostic results from microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests were leveraged to provide a quasi-longitudinal perspective of acute and prolonged effects after malaria infection. RESULTS: The prevalence of both malaria (survey prevalence ranging from 17.4% to 65.2%) and anaemia (survey prevalence ranging from 74% to 88.2%) was very high in the included surveys. Malaria was estimated to significantly reduce haemoglobin levels, with an overall effect of - 7.5 g/dL (95% CI - 8.5, - 6.5). Acute malaria resulted in a - 7.7 g/dL (95% CI - 8.8, - 6.6) decrease in haemoglobin levels. Recent malaria without current parasitaemia decreased haemoglobin concentration by - 7.1 g/dL (95% CI - 8.3, - 5.9). The in-sample predicted prevalence of severe anaemia was 9.4% among malaria positives, but only 2.2% among children without malaria. CONCLUSION: Malaria infection has a strong detrimental effect on haemoglobin levels among young children in Burkina Faso. This effect seems to carry over even after acute infection, indicating prolonged haemoglobin reductions even after successful parasite-elimination. The quasi-experimental fixed-effect approach adds a population level perspective to existing clinical evidence.",,pubmed

The demographic characteristics, symptoms and signs, and laboratory tests of the 2 groups were comparatively analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the risk factors associated with the occurrence of neurosyphilis.Among 81 patients, 33 patients were assigned to the neurosyphilis group, and 48 to the syphilis group. There were no significant differences in the age, gender, marital status, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome course, opportunistic infections, serum HIV viral load, and history of syphilis treatment. The difference in HIV transmission route between the 2 groups was statistically significant (P = .010), and the patients from the neurosyphilis group were mainly infected via heterosexual contact. The proportion of serum toludine red unheated serum test (TRUST) titer >/=1:16 in the neurosyphilis group were 78.8%, which was significantly higher compared to the syphilis group (48.9%). The level of CSF white blood cell count, CSF protein, and CSF HIV viral load in the neurosyphilis group were significantly higher than those of the syphilis group. The proportion of patients with neurological symptoms and signs in the neurosyphilis group was significantly higher compared to the syphilis group (P < .001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that heterosexual contact transmission route, not received antiretroviral therapy, lower CD4 cell count and higher serum TRUST titer, untreated with syphilis, and neurological symptoms and signs were risk factors associated with the occurrence of neurosyphilis.The serum TRUST titer, CSF white blood cell count, CSF protein level, CSF HIV viral load, and the percentage of neurological symptoms and signs in the neurosyphilis group were higher. Heterosexual transmission route, not received antiretroviral therapy, and untreated with syphilis prompted the possibility of neurosyphilis occurrence.",,pubmed

Irrigated ecosystems can be associated with increased malaria risk, but this relationship is not fully understood. We studied this relationship at the Bwanje Valley Irrigation Scheme (800 hectares) in Malawi. Household prevalence of malaria and indoor Anopheles density were quantified in two cross-sectional studies in 2016 and 2017 (5,829 residents of 1,091 households). Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate the association between distance to the irrigation scheme and malaria infection and mosquito density. The prevalence of malaria infection was 50.2% (2,765/5,511) by histidine-rich protein 2-based malaria rapid diagnostic tests and 30.1% (1,626/5,403) by microscopy. Individuals residing in households within 3 km of the scheme had significantly higher prevalence of infection (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18, 1.68); school-aged children had the highest prevalence among age groups (aOR = 1.34; 95% CI 1.11, 1.63). Individuals who reported bed net use, and households with higher socioeconomic status and higher level of education for household head or spouse, had lower odds of malaria infection. Female Anopheles mosquitoes (2,215 total; Anopheles arabiensis, 90.5%, Anopheles funestus, 9.5%) were significantly more abundant in houses located within 1.5 km of the scheme. Proximity of human dwellings to the irrigation scheme increased malaria risk, but higher household wealth index reduced risk. Therefore, multisectoral approaches that spur economic growth while mitigating increased malaria transmission are needed for people living close to irrigated sites.",,pubmed

METHODS: This cohort study was conducted from 2014 to 2019. Pretested standardised questionnaires and tools were used for data collection. The prevalence of LTBI among HHCs of TB patients was summarised as proportion with 95% confidence interval (CI). Mixed-effects generalised linear modelling function (meglm) in STATA with family Poisson and log link was performed to find the factors associated with LTBI. RESULTS: In total, 1523 HHC of pulmonary TB patients were included in the study. Almost all HHC shared their residence with the index case (IC) for more than a year; 25% shared the same bed with the IC. The prevalence of LTBI among the HHC of TB patients was 52.6% (95% CI: 50.1-55.1%). In an adjusted model, we found that among HHC belonging to the age group of 19-64 years (aIRR = 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1-1.3; p-value: 0.02), to the age group >65 years (aIRR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.9, p-value: 0.02) and sharing the same bed with the IC (aIRR = 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.3, p value: 0.04) were independent determinants of LTBI among the HHC. CONCLUSION: One in two household contacts of TB patients have latent tuberculosis infection. This underscores the need of targeted contact screening strategies, effective contact tracing and testing using standardised methods in high TB burden settings.",,pubmed
A261,Estimates of country level temperature-related mortality damage functions.,10.1038/s41598-021-99156-5,Bressler RD; Moore FC; Rennert K; Anthoff D,2021.0,Scientific reports,"Many studies project that climate change is expected to cause a significant number of excess deaths. Yet, in integrated assessment models that determine the social cost of carbon (SCC), human mortality impacts do not reflect the latest scientific understanding. We address this issue by estimating country-level mortality damage functions for temperature-related mortality with global spatial coverage. We rely on projections from the most comprehensive published study in the epidemiology literature of future temperature impacts on mortality (Gasparrini et al. in Lancet Planet Health 1:e360-e367, 2017), which estimated changes in heat- and cold-related mortality for 23 countries over the twenty-first century. We model variation in these mortality projections as a function of baseline climate, future temperature change, and income variables and then project future changes in mortality for every country. We find significant spatial heterogeneity in projected mortality impacts, with hotter and poorer places more adversely affected than colder and richer places. In the absence of income-based adaptation, the global mortality rate in 2080-2099 is expected to increase by 1.8% [95% CI 0.8-2.8%] under a lower-emissions RCP 4.5 scenario and by 6.2% [95% CI 2.5-10.0%] in the very high-emissions RCP 8.5 scenario relative to 2001-2020. When the reduced sensitivity to heat associated with rising incomes, such as greater ability to invest in air conditioning, is accounted for, the expected end-of-century increase in the global mortality rate is 1.1% [95% CI 0.4-1.9%] in RCP 4.5 and 4.2% [95% CI 1.8-6.7%] in RCP 8.5. In addition, we compare recent estimates of climate-change induced excess mortality from diarrheal disease, malaria and dengue fever in 2030 and 2050 with current estimates used in SCC calculations and show these are likely underestimated in current SCC estimates, but are also small compared to more direct temperature effects.",,pubmed

Identification of factors which influence mosquito house entry could lead to development of novel malaria vector control interventions. A study was therefore carried out to identify risk factors associated with house entry of An. gambiae s.l. in south-west Burkina Faso, an area of high insecticide resistance. METHODS: Mosquitoes were sampled monthly during the malaria transmission season using CDC light traps in 252 houses from 10 villages, each house sleeping at least one child aged five to 15 years old. Potential risk factors for house entry of An. gambiae s.l. were measured, including socio-economic status, caregiver's education and occupation, number of people sleeping in the same part of the house as the child, use of anti-mosquito measures, house construction and fittings, proximity of anopheline aquatic habitats and presence of animals near the house. Mosquito counts were compared using a generalized linear mixed-effect model with negative binomial and log link function, adjusting for repeated collections. RESULTS: 20,929 mosquitoes were caught, of which 16,270 (77.7%) were An. gambiae s.l. Of the 6691 An. gambiae s.l. identified to species, 4101 (61.3%) were An. gambiae sensu stricto and 2590 (38.7%) Anopheles coluzzii. Having a metal-roof on the child's sleeping space (IRR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.95, p = 0.03) was associated with fewer malaria vectors inside the home. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the rate of An. gambiae s.l. was 45% lower in sleeping spaces with a metal roof, compared to those with thatch roofs. Improvements in house construction, including installation of metal roofs, should be considered in endemic areas of Africa to reduce the burden of malaria.",,pubmed

METHODS: Data for the country-specific disability-adjusted life year (DALY) number, rate and age-standardised rate of trachoma together with related data of other common eye diseases were acquired from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 database. The Socio-Demographic Index (SDI), Human Development Index (HDI), inequality-adjusted HDI and other related indices were obtained from published data or publicly available databases. Regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the associations between potential risk factors and the age-standardised DALY burden of trachoma. RESULTS: The global DALY burden due to trachoma decreased by 37% from 1990 to 2019 and decreased by 69.8% after adjusting for age and population growth, and, in available 1990-2019 data, had the greatest reduction in attributable DALYs of all common eye disease, with the others analysed being cataract, glaucoma, refractive disorders and age-related macular degeneration. Women had higher age-standardised DALY burden due to trachoma than men (p<0.001). The African region (p<0.001) had the heaviest burden among global regions. The age-standardised DALY rate was higher in countries with lower income (p<0.001) and lower SDI (p<0.001). Higher disease burden due to trachoma was associated with lower HDI (beta=-48.102, 95% CI -86.888 to -9.316, p=0.016), lower SDI (beta=-48.063, 95% CI -83.702 to -12.423, p<0.001) and lower expected years of schooling (beta=-2.352, 95% CI -3.756 to -0.948, p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The global disease burden due to trachoma decreased from 1990 to 2019 and it had the greatest reduction compared with other common eye diseases. Lower HDI, socioeconomic status and educational level were related to a higher national disease burden of trachoma. Our findings could provide necessary information for trachoma control and prevention.",,pubmed

In these environments, physical characteristics of the landscape and sociodemographic factors may influence vector populations at small geographic scales, while prior immunity to the four dengue virus serotypes affects incidence. In 2019, a rural northwestern Ecuadorian community, only accessible by river, experienced a dengue outbreak. The village is 2-3 hours by boat away from the nearest population center and comprises both Afro-Ecuadorian and Indigenous Chachi households. We used multiple data streams to examine spatial risk factors associated with this outbreak, combining maps collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), an entomological survey, a community census, and active surveillance of febrile cases. We mapped visible water containers seen in UAV images and calculated both the green-red vegetation index (GRVI) and household proximity to public spaces like schools and meeting areas. To identify risk factors for symptomatic dengue infection, we used mixed-effect logistic regression models to account for the clustering of symptomatic cases within households. We identified 55 dengue cases (9.5% of the population) from 37 households. Cases peaked in June and continued through October. Rural spatial organization helped to explain disease risk. Afro-Ecuadorian (versus Indigenous) households experience more symptomatic dengue (OR = 3.0, 95%CI: 1.3, 6.9). This association was explained by differences in vegetation (measured by GRVI) near the household (OR: 11.3 95% 0.38, 38.0) and proximity to the football field (OR: 13.9, 95% 4.0, 48.4).

A265,"Increasingly expanded future risk of dengue fever in the Pearl River Delta, China.",10.1371/journal.pntd.0009745,Wu W; Ren H; Lu L,2021.0,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, frequent outbreaks of dengue fever (DF) have become an increasingly serious public health issue in China, especially in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) with fast socioeconomic developments. Previous studies mainly focused on the historic DF epidemics, their influencing factors, and the prediction of DF risks. However, the future risks of this disease under both different socioeconomic development and representative concentration pathways (RCPs) scenarios remain little understood. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, a spatial dataset of gross domestic product (GDP), population density, and land use and land coverage (LULC) in 2050 and 2070 was obtained by simulation based on the different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), and the future climatic data derived from the RCP scenarios were integrated into the Maxent models for predicting the future DF risk in the PRD region. Among all the variables included in this study, socioeconomics factors made the dominant contribution (83% or so) during simulating the current spatial distribution of the DF epidemics in the PRD region. Moreover, the spatial distribution of future DF risk identified by the climatic and socioeconomic (C&S) variables models was more detailed than that of the climatic variables models. Along with global warming and socioeconomic development, the zones with DF high and moderate risk will continue to increase, and the population at high and moderate risk will reach a maximum of 48.47 million (i.e., 63.78% of the whole PRD) under the RCP 4.5/SSP2 in 2070. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing DF risk may be an inevitable public health threat in the PRD region with rapid socioeconomic developments and global warming in the future. Our results suggest that curbs in emissions and more sustainable socioeconomic growth targets offer hope for limiting the future impact of dengue, and effective prevention and control need to continue to be strengthened at the junction of Guangzhou-Foshan, north-central Zhongshan city, and central-western Dongguan city. Our study provides useful clues for relevant hygienic authorities making targeted adapting strategies for this disease.",,pubmed

Objective of this study is to analyze the effects of environmental and social factors on tuberculosis incidence in three Brazilian municipalities and in the Federal District of Brazil. METHODOLOGY: We performed an ecological study carried out with 131,576 new cases of tuberculosis registered in the Brazilian national disease notification system. For our research we used climatic data, topographic data and socioeconomic data. RESULTS: Wind speed and vapor pressure increased the risk of tuberculosis infection between 4.6 and 5.8 times in the 3 municipalities, in comparison with the Federal District. In Recife socioeconomic aspects showed a greater association with tuberculosis. Lack of garbage collection, poor basic sanitation, and access to drinking water, respectively, increased 49, 33, and 28 times the risk of infection. In the multiple regression analysis, Rio de Janeiro showed several environmental characteristics - such as precipitation (p = 0.002), radiation (p = 0.020) and water vapor (p = 0.055) - and social characteristics associated with tuberculosis - such as the lack of sewage treatment, which revealed a 13.5-fold higher risk of infection (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Incidence in the areas studied was influenced by environmental and social conditions at different levels depending on the territory where the problem was identified. The results make it possible to guide an urban and social policy to reach the targets set out in the WHO End tuberculosis Strategy in large Brazilian urban agglomerations.",,pubmed

METHODS: We established a SOT cohort (n = 15 598) and confirmed cases of TB between 2011 and 2015 from the Korean National Health Insurance Database using ICD-10 codes. After excluding 1302 and 180 SOT-recipients due to age (<18 years) and presence of pre-SOT TB and/or treatment for latent TB during wash-out period between 2006 and cohort entry, we analyzed 14 116 SOT recipients and 70 580 individuals with no history of SOT matched by age and sex. The hazard ratios (HRs) of IRs were adjusted for age, sex, low-income status, diabetes mellitus, chronic co-morbidities, and anti-TNF-alpha therapy. RESULTS: The IR of TB was significantly higher (adjusted HR [aHR]: 6.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.5-7.6) in SOT recipients (4.9/1000 person-years) than in non-SOT individuals (0.8/1000 person-years). Of the transplanted organs, the pancreas (pancreas alone and simultaneous pancreas-kidney) and lung had the highest IR (aHR: 16.3 [6.1-42.2] and 16.1 [5.9-43.8], respectively). The use of anti-thymocyte globulin and azathioprine was associated with a higher IR (aHR: 1.53 [1.01-2.43] and 3.92 [1.21-12.47], respectively), but basiliximab was associated with a lower IR (aHR: 0.67 [0.48-0.98]). CONCLUSION: The IR of TB in SOT recipients, especially in the pancreas and lung, was significantly higher than that in the non-SOT population.",,pubmed

Understanding which household characteristics and risk factors lead to higher Ae. aegypti densities and consequent disease risk can help inform and optimize vector control programs. METHODS: Cross-sectional entomological surveys were conducted in Guayaquil between 2013 and 2016, covering household demographics, municipal services, potential breeding containers, presence of Ae. aegypti larvae and pupae, and history of using mosquito control methods. A zero-truncated negative binomial regression model was fitted to data for estimating the household pupal index. An additional model assessed the factors of the most productive breeding sites across all of the households. RESULTS: Of surveyed households, 610 satisfied inclusion criteria. The final household-level model found that collection of large solid items (e.g., furniture and tires) and rainfall the week of and 2 weeks before collection were negatively correlated with average pupae per container, while bed canopy use, unemployment, container water volume, and the interaction between large solid collection and rainfall 2 weeks before the sampling event were positively correlated. Selection of these variables across other top candidate models with ∆AICc < 1 was robust, with the strongest effects from large solid collection and bed canopy use. The final container-level model explaining the characteristics of breeding sites found that contaminated water is positively correlated with Ae. aegypti pupae counts while breeding sites composed of car parts, furniture, sewerage parts, vases, were all negatively correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Having access to municipal services like bulky item pickup was effective at reducing mosquito proliferation in households. Association of bed canopy use with higher mosquito densities is unexpected, and may be a consequence of large local mosquito populations or due to limited use or effectiveness of other vector control methods. The impact of rainfall on mosquito density is multifaceted, as it may both create new habitat and ""wash out"" existing habitat. Providing services and social/technical interventions focused on monitoring and eliminating productive breeding sites is important for reducing aquatic-stage mosquito densities in households at risk for Ae. aegypti-transmitted diseases.",,pubmed

METHODS: Subjects were children with newly diagnosed leprosy registered for treatment at tertiary Leprosy Mission Hospitals in Muzaffarpur (Bihar), Purulia (West Bengal) and Faizabad (Uttar Pradesh), India, between June and December 2019. Demographic and leprosy characteristics were collected at the time of diagnosis. Parents/guardians were interviewed on reasons for delay in presenting at the hospital. Associations between various factors and delay in diagnosis were assessed. RESULTS: Among the 84 children, the mean (SD) age was 10 (3) years with a range of 4-14 years. There were more boys (58%) and most children were currently in school (93%), resident in rural areas (90%) and belonged to a lower socioeconomic status (68%). More children were diagnosed with multibacillary leprosy (69%), one-third of them being skin smear positive for Mycobacterium leprae. On presentation, 17% had deformity (5% grade 1 deformity and 12% grade 2), 29% had nerve involvement and skin lesions were spread across the body in half of the children. Mean (SD) duration of delay was 10.5 (9.8) months. Delayed presentation was more in boys (43% vs. 17%; P = 0.01), those without a history of migration for work compared to those who had a history of migration (40% vs. 9%; P = 0.008) and in those children who were from a poor economic status compared with those that came from a better economic status (44% vs. 7%; P = 0.001) Limitations: Because our study was conducted at tertiary care hospitals, the findings are not representative of the situation in the field. Furthermore, a comparison group of newly diagnosed adult leprosy patients with disability could have been included in the study. CONCLUSION: Childhood leprosy continues to occur in endemic pockets in India and a substantial number present with skin smear positivity and deformity. Guardians of these children cite many reasons for the delay in presentation.",,pubmed

This paper aims to evaluate the effect of the dog population and household environment for the maintenance of natural foci in the transmission to human and animal hosts in an endemic city for VL, Bauru, in Brazil. We collected 6,578 blood samples of dogs living in 3,916 households from Nov.2019 to Mar.2020 and applied geospatial models to predict the disease risk based on the canine population. We used Kernel density estimation, cluster analysis, geostatistics, and Generalized Additive Models (GAM). To validate our models, we used cross-validation and created a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. We found an overall canine VL (CVL) seroprevalence of 5.6% for the sampled dogs, while for the households, the positivity rate was 8.7%. Odds ratios (OR) for CVL increased progressively according to the number of canines for >2 dogs (OR 2.70); households that already had CVL in the past increased the chances for CVL currently (OR 2.73); and the cases of CVL increase the chances for human VL cases (OR 1.16). Our models were statistically significant and demonstrated a spatial association between canine and human disease cases, mainly in VL foci that remain endemic. Although the Kernel density ratio map had the best performance (AUC = 82), all the models showed high risk in the city's northwest area. Canine population dynamics must be considered in public policies, and geospatial methods may help target priority areas and planning VL surveillance in low and middle-income countries.",,pubmed

Understanding village and household-level spatial heterogeneity of malaria risk can support a transition to spatially targeted interventions for malaria elimination. This analysis uses data from cross-sectional prevalence surveys conducted in 2014 and 2016 in two villages (Megiar and Mirap) in Papua New Guinea. Generalised additive modelling was used to characterise spatial heterogeneity of malaria risk and investigate the contribution of individual, household and environmental-level risk factors. Following a period of declining malaria prevalence, the prevalence of P. falciparum increased from 11.4 to 19.1% in Megiar and 12.3 to 28.3% in Mirap between 2014 and 2016, with focal hotspots observed in these villages in 2014 and expanding in 2016. Prevalence of P. vivax was similar in both years (20.6% and 18.3% in Megiar, 22.1% and 23.4% in Mirap) and spatial risk heterogeneity was less apparent compared to P. falciparum. Within-village hotspots varied by Plasmodium species across time and between villages. In Megiar, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of infection could be partially explained by household factors that increase risk of vector exposure, such as collecting outdoor surface water as a main source of water. In Mirap, increased AOR overlapped with proximity to densely vegetated areas of the village. The identification of household and environmental factors associated with increased spatial risk may serve as useful indicators of transmission hotspots and inform the development of tailored approaches for malaria control.",,pubmed

Little is known about the effects of environmental exposures and early-life exposure to infectious diseases common to tropical regions on lipids. In 1119 early adolescent participants in the Entebbe Mother and Baby Study, we used linear regression to examine whether prenatal, childhood or adolescent factors are associated with lipid levels. Reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and elevated triglyceride levels were common (prevalence 31% and 14%, respectively), but elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or total cholesterol (TC) were rare. Current malaria infection was associated with lower mean LDL (adjusted ss - 0.51; 95% CI - 0.81, - 0.21), HDL (adjusted ss - 0.40; 95% CI - 0.56, - 0.23), and TC levels (adjusted ss - 0.62; 95% CI - 0.97, - 0.27), but higher mean triglyceride levels (geometric mean ratio (GMR) 1.47; 95% CI 1.18-1.84). Early-life asymptomatic malaria was associated with modest reductions in HDL and TC. Body mass index (BMI) was positively associated with LDL, TC, and triglycerides. No associations with helminth infection were found. Our findings suggest that early-life factors have only marginal effects on the lipid profile. Current malaria infection and BMI are strongly associated with lipids and important to consider when trying to improve the lipid profile.",,pubmed

However, PLHIV remain at a comparatively higher risk of non-communicable comorbidities. We sought to determine the burden of COPD and its associations in an urban tertiary HIV clinic in Uganda. METHODS AND FINDINGS: HIV-infected adults attending the Makerere University Joint AIDS program; aged >/=30 years without acute ailments were screened for COPD using study questionnaires and spirometry (post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC<0.7). We determined its prevalence and association with demographic characteristics, body mass index (BMI) and known risk factors. Of 288 participants enrolled, 177 (61%) were female; 253 (88%) were from urban residences, median age was 45 years (IQR: 39-51), 71(25%) were 'ever' smokers, 284(99%) reported biomass fuel use and 72(25%) had a history of tuberculosis. All except 1 participant were on antiretroviral therapy, median current CD4 (cells/mm3) was 558 (IQR 402-753) and 275(96%) were virologically suppressed. Nearly half (130/288, 45%) had recurrent respiratory symptoms. The prevalence of COPD was 3.1% (9/288) [95% CI: 1.63-5.92].

The chance of disability is increased by delayed case detection. This review focusses on the individual and community determinants of delayed leprosy case detection. METHODS: This study was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis). The study protocol is registered in PROSPERO (code: CRD42020189274). To identify determinants of delayed detection, data was collected from five electronic databases: Embase.com, Medline All Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and the WHO Global Health Library. RESULTS: We included 27 papers from 4315 records assessed. They originated in twelve countries, had been published between January 1, 2000, and January 31, 2021, and described the factors related to delayed leprosy case detection, the duration of the delayed case, and the percentage of Grade 2 Disability (G2D). The median delay in detection ranged from 12 to 36 months, the mean delay ranged from 11.5 to 64.1 months, and the percentage of G2D ranged from 5.6 to 43.2%. Health-service-seeking behavior was the most common factor associated with delayed detection. The most common individual factors were older age, being male, having a lower disease-symptom perception, having multibacillary leprosy, and lack of knowledge. The most common socioeconomic factors were living in a rural area, performing agricultural labor, and being unemployed. Stigma was the most common social and community factor. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed leprosy case detection is clearly correlated with increased disability and should therefore be a priority of leprosy programs. Interventions should focus on determinants of delayed case detection such as health-service-seeking behavior, and should consider relevant individual, socioeconomic, and community factors, including stigmatization. Further study is required of the health service-related factors contributing to delay.",,pubmed

HIV,"BACKGROUND: The interaction between COVID-19, non-communicable diseases, and chronic infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis is unclear, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries in Africa. South Africa has a national HIV prevalence of 19% among people aged 15-49 years and a tuberculosis prevalence of 0.7% in people of all ages. Using a nationally representative hospital surveillance system in South Africa, we aimed to investigate the factors associated with in-hospital mortality among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this cohort study, we used data submitted to DATCOV, a national active hospital surveillance system for COVID-19 hospital admissions, for patients admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 5, 2020, and March 27, 2021. Age, sex, race or ethnicity, and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, chronic cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease and asthma, chronic renal disease, malignancy in the past 5 years, HIV, and past and current tuberculosis) were considered as risk factors for COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality. COVID-19 in-hospital mortality, the main outcome, was defined as a death related to COVID-19 that occurred during the hospital stay and excluded deaths that occurred because of other causes or after discharge from hospital; therefore, only patients with a known in-hospital outcome (died or discharged alive) were included. Chained equation multiple imputation was used to account for missing data and random-effects multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the role of HIV status and underlying comorbidities on COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. FINDINGS: Among the 219 265 individuals admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and known in-hospital outcome data, 51 037 (23.3%) died. Most commonly observed comorbidities among individuals with available data were hypertension in 61 098 (37.4%) of 163 350, diabetes in 43 885 (27.4%) of 159 932, and HIV in 13 793 (9.1%) of 151 779. Tuberculosis was reported in 5282 (3.6%) of 146 381 individuals. Increasing age was the strongest predictor of COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. Other factors associated were HIV infection (adjusted odds ratio 1.34, 95% CI 1.27-1.43), past tuberculosis (1.26, 1.15-1.38), current tuberculosis (1.42, 1.22-1.64), and both past and current tuberculosis (1.48, 1.32-1.67) compared with never tuberculosis, as well as other described risk factors for COVID-19, such as male sex; non-White race; underlying hypertension, diabetes, chronic cardiac disease, chronic renal disease, and malignancy in the past 5 years; and treatment in the public health sector. After adjusting for other factors, people with HIV not on antiretroviral therapy (ART; adjusted odds ratio 1.45, 95% CI 1.22-1.72) were more likely to die in hospital than were people with HIV on ART. Among people with HIV, the prevalence of other comorbidities was 29.2% compared with 30.8% among HIV-uninfected individuals. Increasing number of comorbidities was associated with increased COVID-19 in-hospital mortality risk in both people with HIV and HIV-uninfected individuals. INTERPRETATION: Individuals identified as being at high risk of COVID-19 in-hospital mortality (older individuals and those with chronic comorbidities and people with HIV, particularly those not on ART) would benefit from COVID-19 prevention programmes such as vaccine prioritisation as well as early referral and treatment.

However, the area is changing, with substantial development, an upsurge in travel associated with resource extraction, and more populated settlements forming. Recently, numerous malaria outbreaks have highlighted the need to characterize malaria transmission and its associated risk factors in the region to inform control strategies. Reactive case detection of confirmed malaria cases at six health facilities across central Turkana was conducted from 2018 to 2019. Infections in household members of index cases were detected by malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and PCR tests, and they were grouped according household and individual characteristics. The relationships between putative risk factors and infection were quantified by multilevel logistic regression models. Of the 3,189 household members analyzed, 33.6% had positive RDT results and/or PCR test results. RDT-detected infections were more prevalent in children; however, PCR-detected infections were similarly prevalent across age groups. Recent travel was rarely reported and not significantly associated with infection. Bed net coverage was low and net crowding was associated with increased risks of household infections. Infections were present year-round, and fluctuations in prevalence were not associated with rainfall. These findings indicate year-round, endemic transmission with moderate population immunity. This is in stark contrast to recent estimates in this area. Therefore, further investigations to design effective intervention approaches to address malaria in this rapidly changing region and other similar settings across the Horn of Africa are warranted.",,pubmed

In tropical regions the transmission risk to humans depends not only on environmental factors, such as vegetation cover and climate, but also on the socioeconomic characteristics of human populations. However, the relative contribution of these factors to disease risk and incidence is not well understood. Yet this information is critical for the development of epidemiological surveillance schemes and control practices. Leishmaniasis cases have increased in Sao Paulo state, Brazil over recent years but the underlying risk factors for transmission remain understudied. Here, we use generalized linear mixed models to quantify the association between occurrence and incidence (number of cases) of cutaneous (CL) and visceral (VL) leishmaniasis from 1998 to 2015, and landscape (native vegetation cover), climate (seasonal and interannual variation in precipitation and temperature) and socioeconomic factors (population, number of cattle heads, Human Development Index - HDI, Gini inequality index and income per capita) across the 645 municipalities of Sao Paulo state, Brazil. For CL, probability of occurrence was greater in municipalities with high native vegetation cover and economic inequality and in years with greater average winter precipitation. For VL, probability of occurrence was greater in years with high minimum spring precipitation and maximum annual temperatures, and in municipalities with larger HDI values and a greater number of cattle heads. The number of VL cases increased during years with high mean fall precipitation and, for both CL and VL the number of cases was greater in years of high annual mean temperature. Understanding how these risk factors influence spatial and temporal variation in the risk and incidence of leishmaniasis can contribute to the development of effective public health policies and interventions.",,pubmed

In Ghana, relatively little is known about the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in homeless and slum dwellers in the major cities of the country. This study aimed at determining the prevalence of CKD among homeless people in Nima and Agbogbloshie, Accra, Ghana, and to evaluate the association between socio demographic characteristics and CKD. METHODS: we recorded information on individuals' socio-demographic characteristics and anthropometric indices, and took blood samples from a total of 512 homeless participants for serum creatinine measurement. Renal function was estimated according to the 4-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Cockcroft-Gault (C-G) equations. RESULTS: participants with normal serum creatinine (SCr), made up of 232 males and 280 females totaling 512 took part in the study. Those with normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were 86% and 84.6% by means of the C-G and MDRD equations respectively. According to the C-G formula, kidney damage and mild to severe renal insufficiency was found in 13.2% of the participants and 4 participants (0.8%) had renal failure. On the other hand, 15.4% of the participants were found to have some kidney damage and mild to severe renal insufficiency according to the MDRD formula with no participant suffering from kidney failure. CONCLUSION: the prevalence of CKD among the homeless Ghanaians was significant, especially among those with hypertension, diabetes and human immunodeficiency syndrome virus (HIV) infection.",,pubmed

Agreement between different models is crucial for providing robust evidence for policy-makers because differences in model properties can influence their predictions. In this study, we compared models implemented by two individual-based model simulators for HIV epidemiology in a heterosexual population with Herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2). For each model simulator, we constructed four models, starting from a simplified basic model and stepwise including more model complexity. For the resulting eight models, the predictions of the impact of behavioural interventions on the HIV epidemic in Yaounde-Cameroon were compared. The results show that differences in model assumptions and model complexity can influence the size of the predicted impact of the intervention, as well as the predicted qualitative behaviour of the HIV epidemic after the intervention. These differences in predictions of an intervention were also observed for two models that agreed in their predictions of the HIV epidemic in the absence of that intervention. Without additional data, it is impossible to determine which of these two models is the most reliable. These findings highlight the importance of making more data available for the calibration and validation of epidemiological models.",,pubmed

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of hospital-acquired TB infection due to persistent exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in healthcare settings. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed an international system of infection prevention and control (IPC) interventions to interrupt the cycle of nosocomial TB transmission. The guidelines on TB IPC have proposed a comprehensive hierarchy of three core practices, comprising: administrative controls, environmental controls, and personal respiratory protection. However, the implementation of most recommendations goes beyond minimal physical and organisational requirements and thus cannot be appropriately introduced in resource-constrained settings and areas of high TB incidence. In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) the lack of knowledge, expertise and practice on TB IPC is a major barrier to the implementation of essential interventions. HCWs often underestimate the risk of airborne Mtb dissemination during tidal breathing. The lack of required expertise and funding to design, install and maintain the environmental control systems can lead to inadequate dilution of infectious particles in the air, and in turn, increase the risk of TB dissemination. Insufficient supply of particulate respirators and lack of direction on the re-use of respiratory protection is associated with unsafe working practices and increased risk of TB transmission between patients and HCWs. Delayed diagnosis and initiation of treatment are commonly influenced by the effectiveness of healthcare systems to identify TB patients, and the availability of rapid molecular diagnostic tools. Failure to recognise resistance to first-line drugs contributes to the emergence of drug-resistant Mtb strains, including multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant Mtb. Future guideline development must consider the social, economic, cultural and climatic conditions to ensure that recommended control measures can be implemented in not only high-income countries, but more importantly low-income, high TB burden settings. Urgent action and more ambitious investments are needed at both regional and national levels to get back on track to reach the global TB targets, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",,pubmed

This has led to the formation of new household structures, i.e. child- and youth-headed households, as children and youths are left to live alone and look after themselves. These types of households are a growing phenomenon in many African countries and are increasingly being recognised as household structures. However, in the absence of an economically active adult, orphans living in these households experience numerous challenges. The socio-economic challenges in Zimbabwe could further exacerbate the conditions of child-headed households. This article discusses findings of an ethnographic inquiry on orphans living in child- and youth-headed households in Zimbabwe. We identified parentification, lack of income and social isolation as risk factors affecting quality of life. Social capital and agency were identified as protective factors enhancing children's quality of life. Our findings suggest that orphans living in child- and youth-headed households are not only victims but are also resilient and can exercise agency. Therefore, interventions to support this vulnerable group should build on their existing resilience and agency.",,pubmed
A282,Reduced thyroxine production in young household contacts of tuberculosis patients increases active tuberculosis disease risk.,10.1172/jci.insight.148271,Devalraju KP; Tripathi D; Neela VSK; Paidipally P; Radhakrishnan RK; Singh KP; Ansari MS; Jaeger M; Netea-Maier RT; Netea MG; Park S; Cheng SY; Valluri VL; Vankayalapati R,2021.0,JCI insight,"In the current study, we followed 839 household contacts (HHCs) of tuberculosis (TB) patients for 2 years and identified the factors that enhanced the development of TB. Fourteen of the 17 HHCs who progressed to TB were in the 15- to 30-year-old age group. At baseline (the ""0"" time point, when all the individuals were healthy), the concentration of the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4) was lower, and there were increased numbers of Tregs in PBMCs of TB progressors. At baseline, PBMCs from TB progressors stimulated with early secretory antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6) and 10 kDa culture filtrate antigen (CFP-10) produced less IL-1alpha. Thyroid hormones inhibited Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) growth in macrophages in an IL-1alpha-dependent manner. Mtb-infected Thra1PV/+ (mutant thyroid hormone receptor) mice had increased mortality and reduced IL-1alpha production. Our findings suggest that young HHCs who exhibit decreased production of thyroid hormones are at high risk of developing active TB disease.",,pubmed

National Framework for Malaria Elimination in India (2016-2030) has been launched with the goal to eliminate malaria by 2030. Understanding the socio-economic and household determinants of malaria at the national level will greatly aid India's malaria elimination efforts. METHODS: The data from Longitudinal Ageing Survey of India (LASI) Wave 1 (2017-2018) survey comprising 70,671 respondents >/= 45 years across all the States and Union Territories were used for the analysis. Simple and multiple logistic regressions were used to obtain the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio respectively of the socio-economic and household variables. RESULTS: The major socio-economic variables that increase the likelihood of malaria are caste ('scheduled tribes'), low education levels and rural residence. The scheduled tribes have 1.8 times higher odds of malaria than the scheduled castes (AOR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.5-2.1). Respondents with high school education (6-12 grade) (AOR: 0.7; 95% CI: 0.6-0.8) and college education (AOR: 0.5; 95% CI: 0.4-0.6) had a very low risk of malaria than those with no school years. Rural residence and occupation (agriculture and allied jobs) also increases the odds of malaria. The major housing determinants are household size (>/= 6), housing type (kutcha), use of unclean fuel, outside water source, improper sanitation (toilet facilities) and damp wall/ceiling. CONCLUSIONS: The study has identified the major socio-economic and housing factors associated with malaria in adults aged 45 and above. In addition to vector and parasite control strategies in the tribal dominated regions of India, improving literacy and housing conditions may help India's malaria elimination efforts.",,pubmed
A284,Treatment seeking delay and associated factors among tuberculosis patients attending health facility in Ethiopia from 2000 to 2020: A systematic review and meta analysis.,10.1371/journal.pone.0253746,Obsa MS; Daga WB; Wosene NG; Gebremedhin TD; Edosa DC; Dedecho AT; Awoke N; Weji BG; Bekele EE,2021.0,PloS one,"BACKGROUND: Treatment seeking delay is defined as the time interval between the onset of the major symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) and the first visit to the formal health care facility. The patient was said to be delayed if the patient visited the health-facility after 3 weeks onset of major symptoms. However, in low-income countries like Ethiopia, the delay in treatment-seeking among tuberculosis patients contributes to a widespread transmission and high prevalence of tuberculosis. METHODS: Studies were retrieved from PubMed, Cochrane Database, Cinahl, Scopus, Mednar, and Google Scholar by employing a combination of search terms with Boolean operators. Heterogeneity across studies was assessed using the Cochrane Q test. A funnel plot was used for visual assessment of publication bias. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore the possible causes of heterogeneity. Egger's weighted regression test at a p-value < 0.05 was used to assess the presence of publication bias. Sensitivity analysis was performed to judge whether the pooled effect size was influenced by individual study. STATA software version 14 was used for all statistical analyses. RESULT: A total of 12 studies with 5122 total sample size were included. The national pooled prevalence of treatment seeking delay was 44.29% (95% CI: 39.805, 48.771). The visual inspection of the funnel plot showed the asymmetrical distribution, and the Egger test showed insignificant (P = 0.348). Patients who did not seek formal health care providers on a first contact had about 7 times more likely to delay than patients who sought formal health care provider on a first contact (OR: 7.192 ((95% CI 5.587-9.257), P = 0.001, I2: 85%). The others independent predictors of delay were rural residence (OR: 3.459 ((95% CI 1.469-8.148), P </= 0.001), extra pulmonary TB (OR: 2.520 ((95% CI 1.761-3.605), 0.180), lower educational level (OR 11.720 ((95% CI 1.006-2.938), P <0.001), and distance more than 10km from health facility (OR: 1.631 ((95% CI (10.858-3.101), P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this review, we identified a substantial treatment seeking delay among TB patients in Ethiopia. And, the independent predictors of delay were treatment sought before formal health care provider, residence of the patient, type of TB, educational level, and distance from a health facility. Thus, we recommend health extension workers, health professionals and other stakeholders to focus on patient education, and to continuously mobilize the whole communities on early treatment seeking with a special emphasis given to where treatment sought before formal health care provider, rural resident, extra pulmonary TB, and a patient living farther than 10km distance from health facility.",,pubmed

We also assessed the impact of late diagnosis (LD) on short-term mortality.Epidemiological records of HIV-infected Singapore residents from the National HIV Registry were linked to death records from the Registry of Births and Deaths for observational analyses. Newly-diagnosed HIV cases with available cluster of differentiation 4 count at time of diagnosis in a 5-year period from 2012 to 2016 were included in the study. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of LD for all deaths excluding suicides and self-inflicted or accidental injuries, and HIV/ acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related deaths occurring within 1 year post-diagnosis were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models with adjustment for age at HIV/AIDS diagnosis. Population attributable risk proportions (PARPs) were then calculated using the adjusted HRs.Of the 1990 newly-diagnosed HIV cases included in the study, 7.2% had died by end of 2017, giving an overall mortality rate of 2.16 per 100 person-years (PY) (95% CI 1.82-2.54). The mortality rate was 3.81 per 100 PY (95% CI 3.15-4.56) in HIV cases with LD, compared with 0.71 (95% CI 0.46-1.05) in non-LD (nLD) cases. Short-term mortality was significantly higher in LD (9.1%) than nLD cases (1.1%). Of the 143 deaths reported between 2012 and 2017, 58.0% were HIV/AIDS-related (nLD 28.0% vs LD 64.4%). HIV/AIDS-related causes represented 70.4% of all deaths which occurred during the first year of diagnosis (nLD 36.4% vs LD 74.7%). The PARP of short-term mortality due to LD was 77.8% for all deaths by natural causes, and 87.8% for HIV/AIDS-related deaths.The mortality rate of HIV-infected persons with LD was higher than nLD, especially within 1 year of diagnosis, and HIV/AIDS-related causes constituted majority of these deaths. To reduce short-term mortality, persons at high risk of late-stage HIV infection should be targeted in outreach efforts to promote health screening and remove barriers to HIV testing and treatment.",,pubmed
A286,Vulnerability of agriculture to climate change increases the risk of child malnutrition: Evidence from a large-scale observational study in India.,10.1371/journal.pone.0253637,Mahapatra B; Walia M; Rao CAR; Raju BMK; Saggurti N,2021.0,PloS one,"INTRODUCTION: The impact of climate change on agriculture and food security has been examined quite thoroughly by researchers globally as well as in India. While existing studies provide evidence on how climate variability affects the food security and nutrition, research examining the extent of effect vulnerability of agriculture to climate change can have on nutrition in India are scarce. This study examined a) the association between the degree of vulnerability in agriculture to climate change and child nutrition at the micro-level b) spatial effect of climate vulnerability on child nutrition, and c) the geographical hotspots of both vulnerability in agriculture to climate change and child malnutrition. METHODS: The study used an index on vulnerability of agriculture to climate change and linked it to child malnutrition indicators (stunting, wasting, underweight and anaemia) from the National Family Health Survey 4 (2015-16). Mixed-effect and spatial autoregressive models were fitted to assess the direction and strength of the relationship between vulnerability and child malnutrition at macro and micro level. Spatial analyses examined the within-district and across-district spill-over effects of climate change vulnerability on child malnutrition. RESULTS: Both mixed-effect and spatial autoregressive models found that the degree of vulnerability was positively associated with malnutrition among children. Children residing in districts with a very high degree of vulnerability were more like to have malnutrition than those residing in districts with very low vulnerability. The analyses found that the odds of a child suffering from stunting increased by 32%, wasting by 42%, underweight by 45%, and anaemia by 63% if the child belonged to a district categorised as very highly vulnerable when compared to those categorised as very low. The spatial analysis also suggested a high level of clustering in the spatial distribution of vulnerability and malnutrition. Hotspots of child malnutrition and degree of vulnerability were mostly found to be clustered around western-central part of India. CONCLUSION: Study highlights the consequences that vulnerability of agriculture to climate change can have on child nutrition. Strategies should be developed to mitigate the effect of climate change on areas where there is a clustering of vulnerability and child malnutrition.",,pubmed

In support of the Namibian National Vector Borne Disease Program's drive to better target interventions based upon risk, we implemented a health facility-based case control study aimed to identify risk factors for symptomatic malaria in Zambezi Region, northern Namibia. A total of 770 febrile individuals reporting to 6 health facilities and testing positive by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) between February 2015 and April 2016 were recruited as cases; 641 febrile individuals testing negative by RDT at the same health facilities through June 2016 were recruited as controls. Data on socio-demographics, housing construction, overnight travel, use of malaria prevention and outdoor behaviors at night were collected through interview and recorded on a tablet-based questionnaire. Remotely-sensed environmental data were extracted for geo-located village residence locations. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify risk factors and latent class analyses (LCA) used to identify and characterize high-risk subgroups. The majority of participants (87% of cases and 69% of controls) were recruited during the 2016 transmission season, an outbreak year in Southern Africa. After adjustment, cases were more likely to be cattle herders (Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR): 4.46 95%CI 1.05-18.96), members of the police or other security personnel (aOR: 4.60 95%CI: 1.16-18.16), and pensioners/unemployed persons (aOR: 2.25 95%CI 1.24-4.08), compared to agricultural workers (most common category). Children (aOR 2.28 95%CI 1.13-4.59) and self-identified students were at higher risk of malaria (aOR: 4.32 95%CI 2.31-8.10). Other actionable risk factors for malaria included housing and behavioral characteristics, including traditional home construction and sleeping in an open structure (versus modern structure: aOR: 2.01 95%CI 1.45-2.79 and aOR: 4.76 95%CI: 2.14-10.57); cross border travel in the prior 30 days (aOR: 10.55 95%CI 2.94-37.84); and outdoor agricultural work at night (aOR: 2.09 95%CI 1.12-3.87). Malaria preventive activities were all protective and included personal use of an insecticide treated net (ITN) (aOR: 0.61 95%CI 0.42-0.87), adequate household ITN coverage (aOR: 0.63 95%CI 0.42-0.94), and household indoor residual spraying (IRS) in the past year (versus never sprayed: (aOR: 0.63 95%CI 0.44-0.90). A number of environmental factors were associated with increased risk of malaria, including lower temperatures, higher rainfall and increased vegetation for the 30 days prior to diagnosis and residing more than 5 minutes from a health facility. LCA identified six classes of cases, with class membership strongly correlated with occupation, age and select behavioral risk factors. Use of ITNs and IRS coverage was similarly low across classes. For malaria elimination these high-risk groups will need targeted and tailored intervention strategies, for example, by implementing alternative delivery methods of interventions through schools and worksites, as well as the use of specific interventions that address outdoor transmission.",,pubmed

Prevention remains a challenge as transmission pathways are poorly understood. Susceptibility and disease manifestations are highly dependent on individual host-immune response. Nutritional deficiencies, such as protein-energy malnutrition, have been linked to reduced cell-mediated immunity, which in the case of leprosy, could lead to a higher chance of active leprosy and thus an increased reservoir of transmissible infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Between June and August 2018, recently diagnosed patients with leprosy and individuals without known contact with cases were enrolled as controls in North Gondar regional health centers. Participants answered survey questions on biometric data, demographics, socioeconomic situation, and dietary habits. Descriptive statistics, univariate, and multivariate logisitic regression examined associations between undernutrition, specifically body mass index (BMI), middle upper arm circumference (MUAC), and leprosy. Eighty-one participants (40 cases of leprosy, 41 controls) were enrolled (75% male) with an average age of 38.6 years (SD 18.3). The majority of cases were multibacillary (MB) (90%). There was a high prevalence of undernutrition with 24 (29.6%) participants underweight (BMI <18.5) and 17 (21%) having a low MUAC. On multivariate analysis, underweight was significantly associated with leprosy (aOR = 9.25, 95% CI 2.77, 30.81). Also found to be associated with leprosy was cutting the size of meals/skipping meals (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.0, 8.32) or not having enough money for food (OR = 10, 95% CI 3.44 29.06). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest a strong association between leprosy and undernutrition, while also supporting the framework that food insecurity may lead to undernutrition that then could increase susceptibility to leprosy. In conclusion, this study highlights the need to study the interplay of undernutrition, food insecurity, and the manifestations of leprosy.",,pubmed

However, the magnitude and associated factors of psychological distress have not been fully studied in China. The aim of the current study was to assess the prevalence of psychological distress in TB patients and to further determine the effects of socio-demographic characteristics, health-related variables, substance use status, social support, and experienced stigma on psychological distress. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among TB patients attending three medical institutions in Dalian, Liaoning Province, Northeast China from November 2020 to March 2021. A structured questionnaire was developed to collect data on patients' socio-demographic characteristics, health-related information, substance use status, psychological distress, family function, doctor-patient relationship, policy support, experienced stigma and so on. The binary logistics regression model was used to determine the associated factors of psychological distress. RESULTS: A total of 473 TB patients were enrolled in this study, and the prevalence of psychological distress was 64.1%. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that patients with a middle school education level or above (OR: 0.521, 95%CI: 0.279-0.974), no adverse drug reactions (OR: 0.476, 95%CI: 0.268-0.846), and regular physical exercise (OR: 0.528, 95%CI: 0.281-0.993) were more likely to stay away from psychological distress.

Our study population comprised 27 nationally representative samples of women of reproductive age (15-49) who were enrolled in the Demographic and Health Surveys and conducted between 2010 and 2019 in SSA. Overall, we found a positive association between being anemic and the ecological exposure to malaria incidence [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.02], and HIV prevalence (AOR = 1.01, CI 1.01-1.02).

For over a decade, the Brazilian Department of Chronic Condition Diseases and Sexually Transmitted Infections and the Ministry of Defense have been conducting the Conscripts Survey aiming to assess the STI prevalence and obtain data on knowledge regarding STIs and risk factors among youth.A cross-sectional study was conducted among conscripts across Brazil aged 17 to 22 years from August to December 2016. It included a self-reported questionnaire containing 74 questions, 25 questions related to awareness and knowledge of STIs and their associated symptoms, routes of transmission, complications and risk factors.A total of 37,282 young men across Brazil were considered for the analysis. The majority resided in the Northeast and Southeast regions (38.9% and 30.0%, respectively), followed by the South (13.9%), North (9.7%), and Central-west (7.5%) regions.

These barriers manifest from low treatment literacy, poverty, gender inequality, malnutrition, societal stigmas regarding HIV, and an absence of available care. It is critical for intervention programs to understand and assist in overcoming these barriers and any additional risks encountered by patients with TB/HIV coinfection. This study analyzes variation in TB/HIV coinfection and risks of negative outcomes among patients with TB/HIV coinfection compared to those without coinfection. (2) Methods: This quantitative study used data from 49,460 patients receiving ART from 241 HIV/AIDS clinics in Haut-Katanga and Kinshasa, two provinces in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Chi-square and logistic regression analysis were performed. (3) Results: Significantly higher proportions of patients with TB/HIV coinfection were men (4.5%; women, 3.3%), were new patients (3.7%; transferred-in, 1.6%), resided in the Kinshasa province (4.0%; Haut-Katanga, 2.7%), and were in an urban health zone (3.9%) or semi-rural health zone (3.1%; rural, 1.2%). Logistic regression analysis showed that after controlling for demographic and clinical variables, TB/HIV coinfection increased the risk of death (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 2.26 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.94-2.64)) and LTFU (AOR, 2.06 (95% CI: 1.82-2.34)). TB/HIV coinfection decreased the odds of viral load suppression (AOR, 0.58 (95% CI: 0.46-0.74)).

Few studies have analyzed the impact of economic empowerment interventions on the psychosocial wellbeing of adolescents living with HIV in low resource communities, and this study aims to examine the mediating mechanism(s) that may explain the relationship between a family economic empowerment intervention (Suubi + Adherence) and mental health outcomes for adolescents (ages 10-16 at enrollment) living with HIV in Uganda. METHOD: We utilized data from Suubi + Adherence, a large-scale six-year (2012-2018) longitudinal randomized controlled trial (N = 702). Generalized structural equation models (GSEMs) were conducted to examine 6 potential mediators (HIV viral suppression, food security, family assets, and employment, HIV stigma, HIV status disclosure comfort level, and family cohesion) to determine those that may have driven the effects of the Suubi + Adherence intervention on adolescents' mental health. RESULTS: Family assets and employment were the only statistically significant mediators during follow-up (beta from -0.03 to -0.06), indicating that the intervention improved family assets and employment which, in turn, was associated with improved mental health. The proportion of the total effect mediated by family assets and employment was from 42.26% to 71.94%. CONCLUSIONS: Given that mental health services provision is inadequate in SSA, effective interventions incorporating components related to family assets, employment, and financial stability are crucial to supporting the mental health needs of adolescents living with HIV in under-resourced countries like Uganda. Future research should work to develop the sustainability of such interventions to improve long-term mental health outcomes among this at-risk group.",,pubmed

The multi-scalar and complex nature of malaria necessitates an understanding of malaria risk factors over time and at multiple levels (e.g., individual, household, community). Surveillance of households in both rural and urban settings over time, coupled with detailed behavioral and geographic data, enables the detection of seasonal trends in malaria prevalence and malaria-associated behaviors as well as the assessment of how the local environments within and surrounding an individual's household impact malaria outcomes. METHODS: Participants from seven sites in Kinshasa Province, DRC were followed for over two years. Demographic, behavioral, and spatial information was gathered from enrolled households. Malaria was assessed using both rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and seasonal trends were assessed. Hierarchical regression modeling tested associations between behavioral and environmental factors and positive RDT and PCR outcomes at individual, household and neighborhood scales. RESULTS: Among 1591 enrolled participants, malaria prevalence did not consistently vary seasonally across the sites but did vary by age and ITN usage. Malaria was highest and ITN usage lowest in children ages 6-15 years across study visits and seasons. Having another member of the household test positive for malaria significantly increased the risk of an individual having malaria [RDT: OR = 4.158 (2.86-6.05); PCR: OR = 3.37 (2.41-4.71)], as did higher malaria prevalence in the 250 m neighborhood around the household [RDT: OR = 2.711 (1.42-5.17); PCR: OR = 4.056 (2.3-7.16)]. Presence of water within close proximity to the household was also associated with malaria outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings suggest that targeting non-traditional age groups, children >5 years old and teenagers, and deploying household- and neighborhood-focused interventions may be effective strategies for improving malaria outcomes in high-burden countries like the DRC.",,pubmed

Despite being HIV-uninfected, the increasing number of children who are HIV-exposed and uninfected (CHEU) often present with developmental alterations. We review seminal and recent evidence on the neurological development of CHEU and associations with early life HIV/antiretroviral exposure. Our conceptual model highlights the numerous exposures and universal risk factors for CHEU developmental disorders. Early studies suggest a significant association between HIV exposure and neurological abnormalities, varying according to the burden of HIV-specific exposures and other risk factors. More recent observations from the modern era are inconsistent, although some studies suggest specific antiretrovirals may adversely affect neurological development of CHEU. As the CHEU population continues to grow, alongside simultaneous increases in types and combinations of antiretrovirals used in pregnancy, long-term monitoring of CHEU is necessary for understanding the effects of HIV/antiretroviral exposure on CHEU developmental outcomes. What this paper adds Evidence on the neurological development of children who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-exposed and uninfected (CHEU) is synthesized. Comparisons are made to children who are HIV-unexposed, across treatment eras and settings, and by antiretroviral drug regimens and drug classes. CHEU exposures are complex and include HIV-specific and universal risk factors which may affect development during the early years of life.",,pubmed

A297,Profiling malaria infection among under-five children in the Democratic Republic of Congo.,10.1371/journal.pone.0250550,Emina JBO; Doctor HV; Ye Y,2021.0,PloS one,"INTRODUCTION: In 2018, Malaria accounted for 38% of the overall morbidity and 36% of the overall mortality in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This study aimed to identify malaria socioeconomic predictors among children aged 6-59 months in DRC and to describe a socioeconomic profile of the most-at-risk children aged 6-59 months for malaria infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used data from the 2013 DRC Demographic and Health Survey. The sample included 8,547 children aged 6-59 months who were tested for malaria by microscopy. Malaria infection status, the dependent variable, is a dummy variable characterized as a positive or negative test. The independent variables were child's sex, age, and living arrangement; mother's education; household's socioeconomic variables; province of residence; and type of place of residence. Statistical analyses used the chi-square automatic interaction detector (CHAID) model and logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 8,547 children included in the sample, 25% had malaria infection. Four variables-child's age, mother's education, province, and wealth index-were statistically associated with the prevalence of malaria infection in bivariate analysis and multivariate analysis (CHAID and logistic regression). The prevalence of malaria infection increases with child's age and decreases significantly with mother's education and the household wealth index. These findings suggest that the prevalence of malaria infection is driven by interactions among environmental factors, socioeconomic characteristics, and probably differences in the implementation of malaria programs across the country. The effect of mother's education on malaria infection was only significant among under-five children living in Ituri, Kasai-Central, Haut-Uele, Lomami, Nord-Ubangi, and Maniema provinces, and the effect of wealth index was significant in Mai-Ndombe, Tshopo, and Haut-Katanga provinces. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study could be used for targeting malaria interventions in DRC. Although malaria infection is common across the country, the prevalence of children at high risk for malaria infection varies by province and other background characteristics, including age, mother's education, wealth index, and place of residence. In light of these findings, designing provincial and multisectoral interventions could be an effective strategy to achieve zero malaria infection in DRC.",,pubmed

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of comorbid hypertension and diabetes, and the underlying risk factors in Mpumza, KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa (SA). METHODS: Data were gathered by the SA Human Sciences Research Council from 587 participants in KwaZulu-Natal in 2015. Percentages were used to describe all the variables. Cross-tabulations and chi2 tests were used to describe variations in the prevalences of hypertension, diabetes and comorbidities according to sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables and lifestyle risk factors. RESULTS: Approximately a third of the participants had hypertension (32%) and 9% had diabetes. The prevalence of comorbid hypertension and diabetes was 6%, and this was significantly higher among women, the aged, the obese, and the formerly married compared with their counterparts. Comorbidity awareness was high (86%). Although most of the participants with comorbidities were being treated with lifestyle changes, insulin and antihypertensive medication (74%), control of comorbidities was low (13%). CONCLUSIONS: The study reported a higher burden of comorbid hypertension and diabetes among vulnerable populations in Mpumza, SA, particularly women, the obese, and those with a low level of education. In addition, control of comorbidities was low. Developing appropriate interventions to improve control of comorbidities can reduce the risk of macrovascular and microvascular diseases in this population.",,pubmed

To estimate prevalence and risk factors of LP and to evaluate their impact on the development of clinical outcomes in the Cohort of the Spanish HIV/AIDS Research Network (CoRIS) during 2004-2018. METHODS: CoRIS is an open prospective multicenter cohort of PLWH, adults, naive to ART at entry. LP was defined as HIV diagnosis with CD4 count </=350 cells/muL or an AIDS defining event (ADE). Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to estimate both prevalence ratios (PR) for the association of potential risk factors with LP and Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for its impact on the development of the composite endpoint (first ADE, first serious non-AIDS event [SNAE] or overall mortality). RESULTS: 14,876 individuals were included. Overall, LP prevalence in 2004-2018 was 44.6%. Risk factors for LP included older age, having been infected through injection drug use or heterosexual intercourse, low educational level and originating from non-European countries. LP was associated with an increased risk of the composite endpoint (IRR: 1.34; 95%CI 1.20, 1.50), ADE (1.39; 1.18, 1.64), SNAE (1.22; 1.01, 1.47) and mortality (1.71; 1.41, 2.08). CONCLUSIONS: LP remains a health problem in Spain, mainly among certain populations, and is associated with greater morbidity and mortality. Public policies should be implemented to expand screening and early diagnosis of HIV infection, for a focus on those at greatest risk of LP.",,pubmed

Targeting appropriate interventions in high-risk populations such as forest and forest-fringe communities is a critical component of malaria elimination efforts in Vietnam. In 2016, a household-level malaria indicator survey was conducted in Phu Yen Province, Vietnam with the aim of assessing the knowledge, behaviors and associated risks of malaria infection among priority mobile and migrant populations (MMPs) working and sleeping in forests and on farms. A total of 4211 people were included in the survey, comprised of 1074 heads of households and 3137 associated household members. Of the 1074 head-of-household respondents, 472 slept in a forest, 92 slept on a farm, 132 slept in both forests and farms, and 378 slept at their villages within the last 12 months. Age, literacy, and occupation were significantly different among those who slept in a forest versus on a farm. Of 301 respondents who answered questions about malaria risk factors at sleeping sites, 35% were somewhat aware of malaria prevention practices, but only 4% could recall at least four malaria prevention messages. Among the same group of 301 respondents, only 29% used nets and only 11% used treated nets. Ownership and use of nets among forest-goers was significantly lower than those who slept on a farm or in their village. Huts without walls were significantly prominent forest sleeping site locations (POR = 10.3; 95% CI 4.67-22.7). All respondents who slept in a forest requested standby malaria drugs and one-third of them self-treated without blood testing. Results from this study highlight the importance of capturing relevant location-specific data among priority populations such as remote forest and farm going mobile and migrant populations in Vietnam. Data regarding behavioral practices, knowledge, preventative measures, and intervention coverage at remote-area transmission sites must be routinely captured to effectively monitor progress and refine targeted intervention strategies accordingly.",,pubmed

METHODS: A survey was applied to the households of the locality to obtain sociodemographic data. In parallel, T. dimidiata insects were collected during one year through community participation. Using PCR, the insects were genotyped, their infection status was assessed, and parasite genotypes infecting the insects were identified. The vector's blood meal sources were identified using a polymerase-heteroduplex chain reaction assay. RESULTS: Seasonal variations in the patterns of infestation by T. dimidiata were observed. An overall infestation rate of 19.46%, a colonisation index of 9.09%, a dispersion rate of 22.15% and a synanthropy index of 80.6% were found. The collected insects were identified as ITS-2 group 2 insects, and a natural infection with T. cruzi of 54.35% was found. TcI and no-TcI genotypes of T. cruzi were found in infected insects. Factors such as rain (P = 0.0006) and temperature (P < 0.0001) were associated with infestation. Analysis of the blood meal sources indicated frequent feeding upon humans and mice. Furthermore, house materials and peridomiciles were found to play an important role in the dynamics of infestation. CONCLUSIONS: The contribution of this study is important for understanding the epidemiology of Chagas disease in rural areas of the state of Veracruz and will help to the establishment of an entomological surveillance system and implementation of prevention and control measures in accordance with the reality of the area.",,pubmed

In the elderly living with the human immunodeficiency virus (EPLHIV), and being treated with antiretroviral medications, the obesity complications escalate and expose the elderly to the risk of noncommunicable diseases. Given that over 3 million EPLHIV in sub-Sahara Africa, we assessed the prevalence of obesity and its associated factors among EPLHIV in a low-resource setting.This was a cross sectional study of EPLHIV aged 50 years and older, being treated with antiretroviral medications from 2004 to 2018. HIV treatment data collected from multiple treatment sites were analyzed. Baseline characteristics of the participants were described, and multivariable relative risk model was applied to assess the associations between obesity (body mass index [BMI] >/=30 kg/m2) and the prespecified potential risk factors.Of the 134,652 in HIV cohort, 19,566 (14.5%) were EPLHIV: 12,967 (66.3%) were normal weight (18.5 </= BMI < 25), 4548 (23.2%) were overweight (25 </= BMI < 30), while 2,051 (10.5%) were obese (BMI >/=30).

In Uganda, literature on HIV in fishing communities has grown extensively since the first country's documented case of HIV in a fishing community in 1985. The current study describes the status of the HIV burden, prevention, and treatment in Ugandan fishing communities. METHOD: This scoping review was conducted based on the York Framework outlined by Arksey and O'Malley. We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases to identify relevant quantitative and qualitative studies on HIV incidence, HIV prevalence, HIV-related risk factors, HIV testing, antiretroviral therapy coverage and adherence, and interventions to improve treatment outcomes and reduce HIV risk factors. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: We identified 52 papers and 2 reports. Thirty-four were quantitative, 17 qualitative, and 3 had a mixed-methods design. Eleven studies reported on the prevalence of HIV and 8 on HIV incidence; 9 studies documented factors associated with HIV incidence or HIV positive status; 10 studies reported on HIV testing coverage and/or associated factors; 7 reported on antiretroviral therapy coverage/adherence/outcomes; and 1 study reported on the impact of combination HIV interventions in fishing communities. This scoping review revealed a significant lack of evidence in terms of what works in HIV prevention and for improving adherence to ART, in contrast to the relatively large amount of evidence from observational quantitative and qualitative studies on HIV prevalence, incidence and related risk factors in Ugandan fishing communities. Intervention studies are urgently needed to fill the current evidence gaps in HIV prevention and ART adherence.",,pubmed

To inform screening initiatives in British Columbia (BC), Canada, the factors associated with HBV and/or HCV and/or HIV infection among different ethnic groups within a large population-based cohort were assessed. METHODS: Persons diagnosed with HBV, HCV, or HIV in BC between 1990 and 2015 were grouped as East Asian, South Asian, Other Visible Minority (African, Central Asian, Latin American, Pacific Islander, West Asian, unknown ethnicity), and Not a Visible Minority, using a validated name-recognition software. Factors associated with infection within each ethnic group were assessed with multivariable multinomial logistic regression models. RESULTS: Participants included 202 521 East Asians, 126 070 South Asians, 65 210 Other Visible Minorities, and 1 291 561 people who were Not a Visible Minority, 14.4%, 3.3%, 4.5%, and 6.3% of whom had HBV and/or HCV and/or HIV infections, respectively. Injection drug use was most prevalent among infection-positive people who were Not a Visible Minority (22.1%), and was strongly associated with HCV monoinfection, HBV/HCV coinfection, and HCV/HIV coinfection, but not with HBV monoinfection among visible ethnic minorities. Extreme material deprivation and social deprivation were more prevalent than injection drug use or problematic alcohol use among visible ethnic minorities. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factor distributions varied among persons diagnosed with HBV and/or HCV and/or HIV of differing ethnic backgrounds, with lower substance use prevalence among visible minority populations. This highlights the need for tailored approaches to infection screening among different ethnic groups.",,pubmed

To identify areas at, and social determinants of health (SDH) associated with, high-risk for schistosomiasis-related mortality from Brazil, we conducted a spatial and spatiotemporal modeling assessing all deaths confirmed in Brazil between 1999 and 2018. We used the segmented log-linear regression model to assess temporal trends, and the local empirical Bayesian estimator, the Global and Local Moran Index for spatial analysis. A total of 12,251 schistosomiasis-related deaths were reported in this period. Within the Mortality Information System (SIM) of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, the states of Alagoas (AL), Pernambuco (PE) and Sergipe (SE) recording the highest mortality rates: 2.21, 1.92 and 0.80 deaths/100,000 inhabitants, respectively. Analyses revealed an increase in the mean age of schistosomiasis-related deaths over the time assessed (APC = 0.9; p-value<0.05). Spatial analysis identified a concentration of municipalities presenting high risk of schistosomiasis-related mortality along the coastline of PE and AL. Similarly, we identified the formation of high space-time clusters in municipalities in the states of PE, AL, SE, Bahia, and Minas Gerais. Finally, mortality rates showed a significant correlation with 96.96% of SDH indices. The data reveal additional important changes in schistosomiasis-related deaths in Brazil between 1999 and 2018, such as a slow reduction among males (unlike females that displayed no change). Regardless, our analyses indicates that schistosomiasis continues to have the greatest detrimental impact in poor regions of Brazil and suggest the need for enhancement of current control measures to accelerate progress.",,pubmed

However, mortality due to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) remains particularly high. Globally, almost 20% of patients started on MDR-TB treatment die during the course of treatment every year. We set out to examine the risk factors for mortality among a cohort of patients diagnosed with MDR-TB in Uganda. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study nested within the national MDR-TB cohort. We defined cases as patients who died from any cause during the course of MDR-TB treatment. We selected two controls for each case from patients alive and on MDR-TB treatment at the time that the death occurred (incidence-density sampling). We matched the cases and controls on health facility at which they were receiving care. We performed conditional logistic regression to identify the risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: Data from 198 patients (66 cases and 132 controls) started on MDR-TB treatment from January 1 to December 31, 2016, was analyzed for this study. Cases were similar to controls in age/sex distribution, occupation and history of TB treatment. However, cases were more likely to be HIV infected while controls were more likely to have attained secondary level education. On multivariate regression analysis, co-infection with HIV (aOR 1.9, 95% CI [1.1-4.92] p = 0.05); non-adherence to MDR-TB treatment (aOR 1.92, 95% CI [1.02-4.83] p = 0.04); age over 50 years (aOR 3.04, 95% CI [1.13-8.20] p = 0.03); and having no education (aOR 3.61, 95% CI [1.1-10.4] p = 0.03) were associated with MDR-TB mortality. CONCLUSION: To mitigate MDR-TB mortality, attention must be paid to provision of social support particularly for older persons on MDR-TB treatment. In addition, interventions that support treatment adherence and promote early detection and management of TB among HIV infected persons should also be emphasized.",,pubmed

METHODS: A large cohort was built from secondary data originated from a national registry of applicants to social benefit programs, covering the period 2001-2015, including over 114 million individuals. Data were linked to the leprosy notification system utilizing data from 2007 until 2014. Descriptive and bivariate analyses lead to a multivariate analysis using a multinomial logistic regression model with cluster-robust standard errors. Associations were reported as Odds Ratios with their respective 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Among the original cohort members 21,565 new leprosy cases were identified between 2007 and 2014. Most of the cases (63.1%) had grade zero disability. Grades 1 and 2 represented 21 and 6%, respectively. Factors associated with increasing odds of grades 1 and 2 disability were age over 15 years old (ORs 2.39 and 1.95, respectively), less schooling (with a clear dose response effect) and being a multibacillary patient (ORs 3.5 and 8.22). Protective factors for both grades were being female (ORs 0.81 and 0.61) and living in a high incidence municipality (ORs 0.85 and 0.67). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the developing of physical disabilities remains a public health problem which increases the burden of leprosy, mainly for those with severe clinical features and worse socioeconomic conditions. Early diagnosis is paramount to decrease the incidence of leprosy-related disability and our study points to the need for strengthening control actions in non-endemic areas in Brazil, where cases may be missed when presented at early stages in disease. Both actions are needed, to benefit patients and to achieve the WHO goal in reducing physical disabilities among new cases of leprosy.",,pubmed

However, in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the risk factors for the LTFU are not well understood. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of risk factors for LTFU among adults living with HIV in SSA. A systematic search of literature using identified keywords and index terms was conducted across five databases: MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science. We included quantitative studies published in English from 2002 to 2019. The Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) was used for methodological validity assessment and data extraction. Mantel Haenszel method using Revman-5 software was used for meta-analysis. We demonstrated the meta-analytic measure of association using pooled odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and heterogeneity using I(2) tests. RESULTS: Thirty studies met the search criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Predictors of LTFU were: demographic factors including being: (i) a male (OR = 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3, I(2) = 59%), (ii) between 15 and 35 years old (OR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.3, I(2) = 0%), (iii) unmarried (OR = 1.2, 95% CI 1.2-1.3, I(2) = 21%), (iv) a rural dweller (OR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.5-2.7, I(2) = 40%), (v) unemployed (OR = 1.2, 95% CI 1.04-1.4, I(2) = 58%); (vi) diagnosed with behavioral factors including illegal drug use(OR = 13.5, 95% CI 7.2-25.5, I(2) = 60%), alcohol drinking (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.9-4.4, I(2) = 39%), and tobacco smoking (OR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.6-4.3, I(2) = 74%); and clinical diagnosis of mental illness (OR = 3.4, 95% CI 2.2-5.2, I(2) = 1%), bed ridden or ambulatory functional status (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.5-3.1, I(2) = 74%), low CD4 count in the last visit (OR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.9, I(2) = 75%), tuberculosis co-infection (OR = 1.2, 95% CI 1.02-1.4, I(2) = 66%) and a history of opportunistic infections (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.7-2.8, I(2) = 75%). CONCLUSIONS: The current review identifies demographic, behavioral and clinical factors to be determinants of LTFU. We recommend strengthening of HIV care services in SSA targeting the aforementioned group of patients. Trial registration Protocol: the PROSPERO Registration Number is CRD42018114418.",,pubmed

Prior work in the region has explored social-ecological factors, dengue case data, and entomological indices. In this study, we bring together entomological and epidemiological data to describe links between social-ecological factors associated with risk of dengue transmission at the household level in Machala, Ecuador. Households surveys were conducted from 2014-2017 to assess the presence of adult Aedes aegypti (collected via aspiration) and to enumerate housing conditions, demographics, and mosquito prevention behaviors. Household-level dengue infection status was determined by laboratory diagnostics in 2014-2015. Bivariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify social-ecological variables associated with household presence of female Ae. aegypti and household dengue infection status, respectively. Aedes aegypti presence was associated with interruptions in water service and weekly trash collection, and household air conditioning was protective against mosquito presence. Presence of female Ae. aegypti was not associated with household dengue infections. We identified shaded patios and head of household employment status as risk factors for household-level dengue infection, while window screening in good condition was identified as protective against dengue infection. These findings add to our understanding of the systems of mosquito-borne disease transmission in Machala, and in the larger region of southern Ecuador, aiding in the development of improved vector surveillance efforts, and targeted interventions.",,pubmed

Mainland China is an area with a high incidence of tuberculosis, and the task of tuberculosis prevention and treatment is arduous. This paper aims to study the impact of seven influencing factors and spatial-temporal distribution of the relative risk (RR) of tuberculosis in mainland China using the spatial-temporal distribution model and INLA algorithm. The relative risks and confidence intervals (CI) corresponding to average relative humidity, monthly average precipitation, monthly average sunshine duration and monthly per capita GDP were 1.018 (95% CI 1.001-1.034), 1.014 (95% CI 1.006-1.023), 1.026 (95% CI 1.014-1.039) and 1.025 (95% CI 1.011-1.040). The relative risk for average temperature and pressure were 0.956 (95% CI 0.942-0.969) and 0.767 (95% CI 0.664-0.875). Spatially, the two provinces with the highest relative risks are Xinjiang and Guizhou, and the remaining provinces with higher relative risks were mostly concentrated in the Northwest and South China regions. Temporally, the relative risk decreased year by year from 2013 to 2015. It was higher from February to May each year and was most significant in March. It decreased from June to December. Average relative humidity, monthly average precipitation, monthly average sunshine duration and monthly per capita GDP had positive effects on the relative risk of tuberculosis. The average temperature and pressure had negative effects. The average wind speed had no significant effect. Mainland China should adapt measures to local conditions and develop tuberculosis prevention and control strategies based on the characteristics of different regions and time.",,pubmed

Few studies have examined what types of community groups and community spaces might be protective for AGYW HIV acquisition and related sexual behaviors. METHODS: Data were obtained from HIV Prevention Trials Network 068, a longitudinal study of AGYW (age 13-20 years) in rural South Africa. Survival analyses and generalized estimating equations were used to assess whether community group membership and time spent in community spaces were associated with HIV incidence and sexual behaviors (unprotected sex, transactional sex, and having an older partner). RESULTS: A total of 2245 AGYW were followed up for up to 4 years. Membership in church groups [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.53 to 0.91] and dance groups (aHR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.80 to 0.98) and spending time at church (aHR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.79 to 0.98) were protective for HIV infection. Conversely, spending time at taverns was associated with higher HIV incidence (aHR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.41). Membership in church groups and spending time at a family member's home and at church were protective for all 3 sexual behaviors. Spending time at a boyfriend's home and taverns was risky for all 3 sexual behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that community spaces and community groups that include an element of adult supervision are potentially protective, whereas spaces and groups that provide an opportunity for AGYW to interact unsupervised with boyfriends or meet new partners are potentially risky.",,pubmed

Burden of TB among symptomatic household contacts of MDR-TB is not extensively studied and screening of symptomatic contacts may provide a better opportunity for optimum management and effective TB control. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted in the department of Tuberculosis & Chest diseases, S.N. Medical College, Agra from February 2016 to January 2018. The study recruited 271 symptomatic household contacts of 87 index MDR-TB cases. Symptomatic contacts were screened for active disease and latent TB infection. Risk factors for the spread of disease were also looked for. RESULTS: Out of 271 symptomatic household contacts, 97 (35.79%) had active TB. Among 97 diseased, 62 (22.87%) had MDR-TB and 35 (12.91%) had drug-susceptible TB. 124 contacts (45%) had latent TB infection. Risk factors associated with occurrence of TB included age less than 18 years (OR = 7160, p = 0.1908, RR = 0.8082, p = 0.1887), male sex (OR = 2.3108, p = 0.0021, RR = 1.7444, p = 0.0034), Sibling as index case (OR = 0.6404, p = 0.0804, RR = 0.7520, p = 0.0806), lack of BCG vaccination (OR = 1.7763, p = 0.0271, RR = 1.4338, p = 0.0247) malnutrition (OR = 1.8980, p = 0.0138, RR = 1.5166, p = 0.0159) and lower socioeconomic status (OR = 3.2399, p < 0.0001, RR = 2.1524, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The high case detection rate by screening symptomatic household contacts shows MDR-TB is highly transmissible and household contacts are at a higher risk of developing active disease. It provides an opportunity for early diagnosis, adequate treatment, and interrupt the chain of transmission. Identifying risk factors help prevent the progression of latent TB infection to active disease.",,pubmed

The purpose of this study is to assess the HRQoL of people living with HIV (PLHIV), and to ascertain its association with the social inequalities and clinical determinants among people living with HIV in Benishangul Gumuz Regional State, Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between December 2016 and February 2017; 390 people at two referral hospitals and three health centers participated in the study. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Health Scale (PROMIS Global 10) was used to measure key HRQoL domains. Global Physical Health (GPH) and Global Mental Health (GPH) summary scores were employed. GPH and GMH summary scores below 50 (the standardized mean score) were determined as poor HRQoL. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with GPH and GMH summary scores. RESULTS: This study included 259 (66.4%) females and 131 (33.6%) males. The GPH summary scores ranged from 16.2 to 67.7 with a mean of 48.8 (SD = 8.9). Almost 44.6% of the study population has a GPH summary score of below 50; the GMH summary scores ranged from 28.4 to 67.6 with a mean of 50.8 (SD = 8.1). About 41.8% of the study population has a GMH summary score of below 50. Unemployment, household food insecurity and comorbidities with HIV were associated with both poor GPH and poor GMH summary scores. Age below 25 years and being a member of Christian fellowship were inversely associated with poor GPH. The least wealth index score and CD4 count below 350 cells/mL were also associated with poor GMH. CONCLUSION: Overall, socioeconomic inequalities and HIV-related clinical factors play an important role in improving the HRQoL of PLHIV. Many of these determinants are alterable risk factors. Appropriate strategies can improve the holistic management of chronic HIV care and maximize PLHIVs' HRQoL. Such strategies require the adoption of comprehensive interventions, including policies and programmes that would improve the health, wellbeing and livelihood of PLHIV.",,pubmed

More data on HIV-positive men (MLHIV) committing IPV are needed to develop perpetrator-focused IPV and HIV prevention interventions. We investigated the relationship between IPV and HIV transmission risk and IPV-associated factors. METHODS: We used data from the cross-sectional survey EVOLCam which was conducted in Cameroonian outpatient HIV structures in 2014. The study population comprised MLHIV declaring at least one sexual partner in the previous year. Using principal component analysis, we built three variables measuring, respectively, self-reported MLHIV-perpetrated psychological and physical IPV (PPV), severe physical IPV (SPV), and sexual IPV (SV). Ordinal logistic regressions helped investigate: i) the relationship between HIV transmission risk (defined as unstable aviremia and inconsistent condom use) and IPV variables, ii) factors associated with each IPV variable. RESULTS: PPV, SPV and SV were self-reported by 28, 15 and 11% of the 406 study participants, respectively. IPV perpetrators had a significantly higher risk of transmitting HIV than non-IPV perpetrators. Factors independently associated with IPV variables were: i) socio-demographic, economic and dyadic factors, including younger age (PPV and SPV), lower income (PPV), not being the household head (SPV and SV), living with a main partner (SPV), and having a younger main partner (SPV); ii) sexual behaviors, including >/=2 partners in the previous year (PPV and SPV), lifetime sex with another man (SPV), inconsistent condom use (SV), and >20 partners during lifetime (SV); iii) HIV-related stigma (PPV and SV). CONCLUSION: IPV perpetrators had a higher risk of transmitting HIV and having lifetime and recent risky sexual behaviors. Perpetrating IPV was more frequent in those with socioeconomic vulnerability and self-perceived HIV-related stigma. These findings highlight the need for interventions to prevent IPV by MLHIV and related HIV transmission to their(s) partner(s).",,pubmed

Dengue is one of these major diseases spreading in cities today, with its principal mosquito vector superbly adapted to the urban environment. Current mosquito control strategies are proving inadequate, especially in the face of such urbanisation and novel, evidence-based targeted approaches are needed. Through combined epidemiological and entomological approaches, we aimed to identify a novel sanitation strategy to alleviate the burden of dengue through how the dengue virus spreads through the community. We combined surveillance case mapping, prospective serological studies, year-round mosquito surveys, socio-economic and Knowledge Attitudes and Practices surveys across Delhi. We identified lack of access to tap water (</=98%) as an important risk factor for dengue virus IgG sero-positivity (adjusted Odds Ratio 4.69, 95% C.I. 2.06-10.67) and not poverty per se. Wealthier districts had a higher dengue burden despite lower mosquito densities than the Intermediary income communities (adjusted Odds Ratio 2.92, 95% C.I. 1.26-6.72). This probably reflects dengue being introduced by people travelling from poorer areas to work in wealthier houses. These poorer, high density areas, where temperatures are also warmer, also had dengue cases during the winter. Control strategies based on improved access to a reliable supply of tap water plus focal intervention in intra-urban heat islands prior to the dengue season could not only lead to a reduction in mosquito abundance but also eliminate the reservoir of dengue virus clearly circulating at low levels in winter in socio-economically disadvantaged areas.",,pubmed

Few studies have examined this relation longitudinally, and no studies have explored how the frequency of food insecurity over time may impact cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the impact of food insecurity on cognitive impairment over a 2-y follow-up period in a cohort of people living with and without HIV. METHODS: This was a 2-y longitudinal analysis of primarily economically disadvantaged, middle-aged, Black, and Hispanic participants from the Miami Adult Studies on HIV (MASH) cohort. Food insecurity was assessed with the USDA Household Food Security Module at baseline and 12- and 24-mo follow-ups. Food insecurity in all 3 assessments was considered persistent food insecurity. Cognitive impairment was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination. Statistical analyses consisted of logistic regressions. RESULTS: A total of 394 participants (247 HIV positive) with 2-y follow-up data were included in this analysis. At baseline, 104 (26.4%) were food-insecure and 58 (14.7%) had cognitive impairment. Very low food security was associated with cognitive impairment at baseline (OR: 3.23; 95% CI: 1.08, 9.65). PLWH not virally suppressed had higher risk for cognitive impairment compared with HIV-uninfected participants (OR: 2.87; 95% CI: 1.15, 7.18). Additionally, baseline food insecurity (OR: 2.28; 95% CI: 1.08, 4.81) and the frequency of food insecurity over time (OR: 1.50 per year; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.10), particularly persistent food insecurity (OR: 3.69; 95% CI: 1.15, 11.83), were associated with cognitive impairment at 2-y follow-up; the results were consistent after excluding cognitively impaired participants at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Food insecurity is a significant risk factor for cognitive impairment, particularly among individuals who experience food insecurity frequently or persistently. Screening for food insecurity and interventions to secure access to sufficient, nutritious foods may help delay cognitive decline among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals.",,pubmed

We conducted a comparative investigation of the effect of the timing of a mother's death on child survival up to age five years in rural South Africa. METHODS: We used discrete time survival analysis on data from two HIV-endemic population surveillance sites (2000-2015) to estimate a child's risk of dying before and after their mother's death. We tested if this relationship varied between sites and by availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We assessed if related adults in the household altered the effect of a mother's death on child survival. FINDINGS: 3,618 children died from 2000-2015. The probability of a child dying began to increase in the 7-11 months prior to the mother's death and increased markedly in the 3 months before (2000-2003 relative risk = 22.2, 95% CI = 14.2-34.6) and 3 months following her death (2000-2003 RR = 20.1; CI = 10.3-39.4). This increased risk pattern was evident at both sites. The pattern attenuated with ART availability but remained even with availability at both sites. The father and maternal grandmother in the household lowered children's mortality risk independent of the association between timing of mother and child mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The persistence of elevated mortality risk both before and after the mother's death for children of different ages suggests that absence of maternal care and abrupt breastfeeding cessation might be crucial risk factors. Formative research is needed to understand the circumstances for children when a mother is very ill or dies, and behavioral and other risk factors that increase both the mother and child's risk of dying. Identifying families when a mother is very ill and implementing training and support strategies for other members of the household are urgently needed to reduce preventable child mortality.",,pubmed
A323,Protective impacts of household-based tuberculosis contact tracing are robust across endemic incidence levels and community contact patterns.,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008713,Havumaki J; Cohen T; Zhai C; Miller JC; Guikema SD; Eisenberg MC; Zelner J,2021.0,PLoS computational biology,"There is an emerging consensus that achieving global tuberculosis control targets will require more proactive case finding approaches than are currently used in high-incidence settings. Household contact tracing (HHCT), for which households of newly diagnosed cases are actively screened for additional infected individuals is a potentially efficient approach to finding new cases of tuberculosis, however randomized trials assessing the population-level effects of such interventions in settings with sustained community transmission have shown mixed results. One potential explanation for this is that household transmission is responsible for a variable proportion of population-level tuberculosis burden between settings. For example, transmission is more likely to occur in households in settings with a lower tuberculosis burden and where individuals mix preferentially in local areas, compared with settings with higher disease burden and more dispersed mixing. To better understand the relationship between endemic incidence levels, social mixing, and the impact of HHCT, we developed a spatially explicit model of coupled household and community transmission. We found that the impact of HHCT was robust across settings of varied incidence and community contact patterns. In contrast, we found that the effects of community contact tracing interventions were sensitive to community contact patterns. Our results suggest that the protective benefits of HHCT are robust and the benefits of this intervention are likely to be maintained across epidemiological settings.",,pubmed

We develop a multi-indicator multistep approach to model the malaria risks at the population level in western Kenya. We used a combination of cross-sectional seasonal malaria infection prevalence, vector density, and cohort surveillance of malaria incidence at the village level to classify villages into malaria risk groups through unsupervised classification. Generalized boosted multinomial logistics regression analysis was performed to determine village-level risk factors using environmental, biological, socioeconomic, and climatic features. Thirty-six villages in western Kenya were first classified into two to five operational groups based on different combinations of malaria risk indicators. Risk assessment indicated that altitude accounted for 45-65% of all importance value relative to all other factors; all other variable importance values were < 6% in all models. After adjusting by altitude, villages were classified into three groups within distinct geographic areas regardless of the combination of risk indicators. Risk analysis based on altitude-adjusted classification indicated that factors related to larval habitat abundance accounted for 63% of all importance value, followed by geographic features related to the ponding effect (17%), vegetation cover or greenness (15%), and the number of bed nets combined with February temperature (5%). These results suggest that altitude is the intrinsic factor in determining malaria transmission risk in western Kenya. Malaria vector larval habitat management, such as habitat reduction and larviciding, may be an important supplement to the current first-line vector control tools in the study area.",,pubmed

Food-insecure individuals often depend on low-cost, energy-dense but nutritionally poor foods, resulting in obesity and chronic diseases related to NAFLD. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether food insecurity is associated with NAFLD in a cohort of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected and uninfected adults. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of low-income, middle-aged adults from the Miami Adult Studies on HIV (MASH) cohort without a history of excessive alcohol consumption. Food security was assessed with the USDA's Household Food Security Survey. MRIs were used to assess liver steatosis and fibrosis. Metabolic parameters were assessed from fasting blood, anthropometrics, and vitals. RESULTS: Of the total 603 participants, 32.0% reported food insecurity. The prevalences of NAFLD, fibrosis, and advanced fibrosis were 16.1%, 15.1%, and 4.6%, respectively. For every 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI, the odds of NAFLD increased by a factor of 3.83 (95% CI, 2.37-6.19) in food-insecure participants compared to 1.32 (95% CI, 1.04-1.67) in food-secure participants. Food insecurity was associated with increased odds for any liver fibrosis (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.01-2.72) and advanced liver fibrosis (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.22-6.54), adjusted for confounders. HIV and HCV infections were associated with increased risks for fibrosis, but the relationship between food insecurity and liver fibrosis did not differ between infected and uninfected participants. CONCLUSIONS: Among low-income, middle-aged adults, food insecurity exacerbated the risk for NAFLD associated with a higher BMI and independently increased the risk for advanced liver fibrosis. People who experience food insecurity, particularly those vulnerable to chronic diseases and viral infections, may be at increased risk for liver-related morbidity and mortality. Improving access to adequate nutrition and preventing obesity among low-income groups may lessen the growing burden of NAFLD and other chronic diseases.",,pubmed
A326,Brief Report: Lower Socioeconomic Status Associates With Greater Systemic and Arterial Inflammation in HIV.,10.1097/QAI.0000000000002630,Zhang L; Abohashem S; Osborne MT; Naddaf N; Park R; Moore K Jr; Patrich T; Deeks SG; Hsue PY; Tawakol AA,2021.0,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),"OBJECTIVES: In the general population, the lower socioeconomic status (SES) associates with greater systemic and arterial inflammation and a greater risk of cardiovascular disease. Because arterial inflammation is heightened in individuals living with HIV, we tested the hypothesis that SES associates with arterial inflammation in this population. SETTINGS: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: Men living with HIV were recruited. Arterial inflammation and leukopoietic activity (ie, bone marrow activity) were measured using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Zip code-level SES measures were derived from the US Census Bureau. Linear regression and mediation analyses were used to assess associations between SES, arterial inflammation, leukopoietic activity, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6. RESULTS: Thirty-nine virologically suppressed men living with HIV were studied (mean +/- SD age 50.5 +/- 11.1 years). The median CD4 count was 663 cells/mm3 (interquartile range: 399-922); 82% were receiving antiretroviral therapies. Local median income inversely associated with arterial inflammation [standardized beta (95% confidence interval): -0.42 (-0.76 to -0.08)] after adjusting for age, Framingham risk score, statin use, antiretroviral use, and nadir CD4 count. The high-school graduation rate independently associated with arterial inflammation [-0.45 (-0.78 to -0.12)] and CRP [-0.49 (-0.86 to -0.012)]. Mediation analysis demonstrated the impact of SES on arterial inflammation was partially mediated by heightened circulating inflammatory levels:  downward arrowSES (as high school graduation rate) --> upward arrowCRP --> upward arrowarterial inflammation accounting for 44% of the total effect (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In individuals living with HIV, lower SES independently associated with higher leukopoietic activity, circulating markers of inflammation, and arterial inflammation. Furthermore, the link between SES and arterial inflammation was mediated by increased systemic inflammation.",,pubmed

We modeled the change in HIV incidence among South African adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) associated with combining a cash transfer (the South African Child Support Grant (CSG)) with other structural and behavioral interventions. We modeled observational data from the HPTN 068 study where 2328 HIV negative AGYW (13-20 years) were followed for 4 years. In a Monte Carlo simulation based on this cohort (N = 10,000), CSG receipt was not independently associated with HIV incidence. Providing the CSG combined with increasing caregiver care and reducing adolescent depression had the largest reduction in HIV incidence with the fewest number of combined interventions (RD - 3.0%; (95% CI - 5.1%, - 0.9%). Combining a monthly grant with interventions to increase caregiver care and reduce adolescent depression could substantially reduce HIV incidence above the provision of cash alone.",,pubmed

This study utilized nationally representative secondary data extracted from the 2015 Nigeria Malaria Indicator Survey (NMIS) to investigate the spatial variability in malaria distribution in those under- 5 and to explore the influence of socioeconomic and demographic factors on malaria prevalence in this population group. To account for spatial correlation, a Spatially Generalized Linear Mixed Model (SGMM) was employed and predictive risk maps was developed using Kriging. Highly significant spatial variability in under-5 malaria distribution was observed (P<0.0001) with a higher likelihood of malaria prevalence in this group in the Northwest and North-east of the country. The number of malaria infections increased with age, children aged between 49-59 months were found to be at a higher risk (Odds Ratio=4.680, 95% CI=3.674 to 5.961 at P<0.0001). After accounting for spatial correlation, we observed a strong significant association between the non-availability or non-use of mosquito bed-nets, low household socioeconomic status, low level of mother's educational attainment, family size, anaemia prevalence, rural type of residence and under-5 malaria prevalence. Faced with a high rate of under-5 mortality due to malaria in Nigeria, targeted interventions (which requires the identification of the child's location) may reduce malaria prevalence, and we conclude that socioeconomic impediments need to be confronted to reduce the burden of childhood malaria infection.",,pubmed

METHODS: Outbreak investigations were triggered by recognition of case clusters in the VL surveillance system established for the elimination program. Investigations included ascertainment of all VL cases by date of fever onset, household mapping and structured collection of risk factor data. RESULTS: VL outbreaks were investigated in 13 villages in 10 blocks of 7 districts. Data were collected for 20,670 individuals, of whom 272 were diagnosed with VL between 2012 and 2019. Risk was significantly higher among 10-19 year-olds and adults 35 or older compared to children younger than 10 years. Outbreak confirmation triggered vector control activities and heightened surveillance. VL cases strongly clustered in tolas (hamlets within villages) in which > 66% of residents self-identified as scheduled caste or scheduled tribe (SC/ST); 79.8% of VL cases occurred in SC/ST tolas whereas only 24.2% of the population resided in them. Other significant risk factors included being an unskilled non-agricultural laborer, migration for work in a brick kiln, living in a kuccha (mud brick) house, household crowding, habitually sleeping outside or on the ground, and open defecation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data highlight the importance of sensitive surveillance with triggers for case cluster detection and rapid, careful outbreak investigations to better respond to ongoing and new transmission. The strong association with SC/ST tolas suggests that efforts should focus on enhanced surveillance in these disadvantaged communities.",,pubmed

This study aimed to assess the predictors of test positivity among people living in Paletwa Township of Chin State, an area of persistently high malaria burden. METHODS: Four villages with the highest malaria incidence from Paletwa Township were purposively selected. The characteristics of 1045 subjects seeking malaria diagnosis from the four assigned village health volunteers from January to December, 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Their household conditions and surroundings were also recorded using a checklist. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were applied to investigate potential associations between individual and household characteristics and malaria diagnosis. RESULTS: In 2017, the Paletwa township presented 20.9% positivity and an annual parasite index of 46.9 cases per 1000 people. Plasmodium falciparum was the predominant species and accounted for more than 80.0% of all infections. Among 1045 people presenting at a clinic with malaria symptoms, 31.1% were diagnosed with malaria. Predictors for test positivity included living in a hut [adjusted odds ratios (a OR): 2.3, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.2-4.6], owning farm animals (aOR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-3.6), using non-septic type of toilets (aOR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-8.4), presenting with fever (aOR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.0), having a malaria episode within the last year (aOR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.4-5.8), traveling outside the village in the previous 14 days (aOR: 4.5, 95% CI: 1.5-13.4), and not using bed nets (a OR: 3.4, 95% CI: 2.3-5.1). There were no statistically significant differences by age or gender in this present analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study, including a high proportion of P. falciparum infections, little difference in age, sex, or occupation, suggest that malaria is a major burden for these study villages. Targeted health education campaigns should be introduced to strengthen synchronous diagnosis-seeking behaviors, tighten treatment adherence, receiving a diagnosis after traveling to endemic regions, and using bed nets properly. We suggest increased surveillance, early diagnosis, and treatment efforts to control the disease and then to consider the local elimination.",,pubmed

We aimed to evaluate potential factors associated with AIDS-related death among adult HIV-infected inpatients in Kisangani, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). METHODS: this is a hospital-based retrospective, observational analysis carried out between 1(st) January 2019 and 31(st) March 2020 among inpatients HIV, at 12 facilities integrating the HIV prevention and care packages in Kisangani. Factors associated with AIDS-related death were analyzed using the logistic regression models. RESULTS: a total of 347 HIV-infected inpatients were included. Among those, the rate of AIDS-related death was 25.1% (95% CI: 20.8-29.9). The rates of AIDS-related death were lower among patients with a university education (aOR: 0.03 [95% CI: 0.00-1.0]) and higher among patients in WHO clinical stage 4 (aOR: 15.4 [6.8-27.8]), patients with poor highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) observance (aOR: 14.5 [2.3-40.4), and patients suffering from opportunistic infections (aOR: 9.3 [95% CI: 3.4-25.1]), including cryptococcal meningitis (aOR: 27 [95% CI: 6.0-125.7]) and viral infections associated with zona and Kaposi sarcoma (aOR: 4.8 [95% CI: 2.2-10.4]). CONCLUSION: in our retrospective study on a large sample of inpatients hospitalized in Kisangani, classic causes of death were found. The association with the low level of education suggests that the economic level of the patients who die is a determining factor, difficult to correct. The identification of a limited number of other factors will allow a better medical management.",,pubmed

We sought to identify correlates of syphilis among women enrolled in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) to inform targeted interventions. METHODS: The retrospective cross-sectional analysis of secondary data included women with HIV or at-risk of HIV who enrolled in the multisite US WIHS cohort between 1994 and 2015. Syphilis screening was performed at baseline. Infection was defined serologically by a positive rapid plasma reagin test with confirmatory treponemal antibodies. Sociodemographic and behavioural characteristics stratified by baseline syphilis status were compared for women enrolled during early (1994-2002) and recent (2011-2015) years. Multivariable binomial modelling with backward selection (p>0.2 for removal) was used to model correlates of syphilis. RESULTS: The study included 3692 women in the early cohort and 1182 women in the recent cohort. Syphilis prevalence at enrolment was 7.5% and 3.7% in each cohort, respectively (p<0.01). In adjusted models for the early cohort, factors associated with syphilis included age, black race, low income, hepatitis C seropositivity, drug use, HIV infection and >100 lifetime sex partners (all p<0.05). In the recent cohort, age (adjusted prevalence OR (aPOR) 0.2, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.6 for 30-39 years; aPOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.0 for 40-49 years vs >/=50 years), hepatitis C seropositivity (aPOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.1) and problem alcohol use (aPOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.4) were associated with infection. CONCLUSIONS: Syphilis screening is critical for women with HIV and at-risk of HIV. Targeted prevention efforts should focus on women with hepatitis C and problem alcohol use.",,pubmed

The recommended SAFE strategy (Surgery, antibiotics, face washing and environmental improvement) is currently not fully implemented in many areas of Burundi. The existence of associations between face-washing, sanitation and trachoma prevalence remain undocumented. METHODS: A convenience sample of 468 individuals from 117 households was drawn from attendees at trachoma clinics set up in four villages. Trachoma status, sex and age were recorded for all household members. Adult household members were surveyed about access to clean water and toilets, and knowledge of trachoma risk factors. Associations between cases of active trachoma per household and environmental risk factors were evaluated using generalised estimating equations. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of active trachoma was 7.1% (95% CI 5.0-9.6%), but 19.5% (95% CI13.7-26.4%) in children under nine years old. 0.9% (95% CI 0.3-2.0) of participants had trichiasis. Access to a sanitary toilet more than halved the odds of active trachoma (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25-0.74%), however, participants did not appreciate this association. CONCLUSION: Access to sanitation was associated with the occurrence of active trachoma.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study amongst 253 HIV patients in Bushenyi district assessed their nutritional status using the body mass index (BMI) and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), and a questionnaire was used to identify major risk factors. RESULTS: The mean age of the study participants was 38.74 +/- 0.80 yrs, while females and males were 52.2% and 47.8% respectively. Prevalence of malnutrition was 10.28% (95% CI: 6.82 - 14.69) in the study. Major socio-economic factors associated with malnutrition were being female, unemployed, dependent and with many family members. Patients with opportunistic infections, low adherence to HAART, and stage of HIV/AIDS had a higher risk of malnutrition. DISCUSSION: In rural communities, a majority of malnourished patients are elderly and these were identified as priority groups for HIV outreach campaigns. The current policy of prioritizing children and women is outdated due to changing disease dynamics, thus showing a need to revise extension service provision in rural communities.

Madhya Pradesh state in central India is one of the most vulnerable states for malaria morbidity and mortality. Socio-economic, environmental and demographic factors present challenges in malaria control and elimination. As part of the Malaria Elimination Demonstration Project in the tribal district of Mandla in Madhya Pradesh, this study was undertaken to assess the role of different social-economic factors contributing to malaria incidence. METHODS: The study was conducted in the 1233 villages of district Mandla, where 87% population resides in rural areas. The data was collected using the android based mobile application-SOCH for a period of 2 years (September 2017 to August 2019). A wealth index was computed along with analysis of the socio-economic characteristics of houses with malaria cases. Variables with significant variation in malaria cases were used in logistic regression. RESULTS: More than 70% of houses in Mandla are Kuccha (made of thatched roof or mud), 20% do not have any toilet facilities, and only 11% had an annual income of more than 50,000 INR, which converts to about $700 per year. Households with younger heads, male heads, more number of family members were more likely to have malaria cases. Kuccha construction, improper water supply, low household income houses were also more likely to have a malaria case and the odds doubled in houses with no toilet facilities. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the study, it has been found that there is an association between the odds of having malaria cases and different household variables such as age, gender, number of members, number of rooms, caste, type of house, toilet facilities, water supply, cattle sheds, agricultural land, income, and vector control interventions. Therefore, a better understanding of the association of various risk factors that influence the incidence of malaria is required to design and/or deploy effective policies and strategies for malaria elimination. The results of this study suggest that appropriate economic and environmental interventions even in low-income and poverty-stricken tribal areas could have huge impact on the success of the national malaria elimination goals.",,pubmed

In Ethiopia, 320,000 preterm births occur each year; out of these, 24,400 deaths were due to preterm complications. However, there is little evidence about preterm birth in the study area. Therefore, this study provides an important direction for health professionals, health programmers, and researchers. A facility-based unmatched case-control study design was employed among 244 women (61 cases and 183 controls) who gave birth in Dilla University Referral Hospital and were selected with purposive sampling. The bivariate and multivariable logistic regression model was used to select independent predictors of preterm birth. The multivariate analysis was used, and the results were interpreted using an adjusted odds ratio at 95% confidence interval and statistically significant level at a P value less than 0.05. A total of 240 mothers (60 cases and 180 controls) were included in the study with a 98.3% response rate. Factors like attending secondary educational and above [adjusted odd ratio (aOR) = 0.07 (0.08-0.65)] and attending antenatal care [aOR = 0.41 (0.18-0.93)] were protective whereas having urinary tract infection [aOR = 3.6 (1.1-11)], having human immune virus diseases [aOR = 4.2 (0.9-18)], having a history of abortion [aOR = 2.3 (1.1-5)], having a history of preterm delivery [aOR = 5 (1.6-15)], and having hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [aOR = 5 (1.9-13)] were significantly associated risk factors for preterm birth. The main determinant factors for preterm birth are having antenatal care follow-up, attending secondary education and above, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, having HIV/AIDS, and history of abortion. This shows a need to strengthen female education; screen mothers for HIV/AIDS, urinary tract infection, and hypertension; and strengthen nutritional counseling, during ANC visits.",,pubmed

Factors related to the duration of HIV/AIDS patients were analyzed by univariate and multivariate Cox regression models. Results: A total of 14 856 patients with HIV/AIDS were involved in this study and with the average duration of survival time as 98.74 (95%CI: 97.73-99.75) months.

Conclusions: Strategies involving early detection of HIV infection, improvement of the CD(4) initial detection rate and early antiviral treatment will help to significantly reduce the risk of death in HIV/AIDS population. Focus should be on male, middle-aged and elderly (over 41 years old), junior high school education or below farmers and migrant worker populations.",,pubmed

The current infection risk is based on acute case reports, most of which are typically associated with oral transmissions. In the semi-arid region of Northeastern Brazil, serious outbreaks of this transmission type have surged in the last years. One of those occurred in 2016 in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. Rural residents of four municipalities surrounding Marcelino Vieira ingested sugar cane juice - which was probably ground with Trypanosoma cruzi-infected insects. Eighteen cases of Chagas disease were confirmed serologically, with two deaths reported. Socioeconomic information, schooling of residents and the structure of peridomestic and domestic environments in the rural area of Marcelino Vieira, along with entomological indicators, were investigated to understand better the factors related to the outbreaks in this region. We found triatomines (mainly Triatoma brasiliensis) in 35% (24/67) of domiciliary units and all rocky outcrops inspected (n = 7). Overall, 25% (91/357) of examined T. brasiliensis were infected by T. cruzi in artificial ecotopes, with almost the same prevalence in the sylvatic environment (22%; 35/154). Among all ecotopes investigated, wood/tile/brick piles were the ones linked to high insect infestations and triatomine T. cruzi infection prevalence. Ninety-five percent of people interviewed recognized the triatomines and knew the classic route of transmission of disease - triatomine bite-dependent. However, only 7.5% admitted knowledge that Chagas disease can also be acquired orally - which poses a risk this transmission route currently recognized. Here, we highlight the physical proximity between humans and triatomine populations with high T. cruzi infection prevalence as an additional risk factor to oral/vector contaminations. In sum, residents have low income, low level of education, and/or a willful disregard for the routes of Chagas disease transmission (specifically oral transmission), a combination of factors that may have favored the Chagas disease outbreak. We here provide recommendations to avoid further outbreaks.",,pubmed
A340,Impacts on knowledge and testing on HIV in waves of Mozambique surveys with Bayes estimates.,10.1371/journal.pone.0244563,Chen Z; Dornelles A; Fang D; Wilson JR,2020.0,PloS one,"BACKGROUND: It is well known that it is more reliable to investigate the effects of several covariates simultaneously rather than one at time. Similarly, it is more informative to model responses simultaneously, as more often than not, the multiple responses from the same subject are correlated. This is particularly true in the analysis of Mozambique survey data from 2009 and 2018. METHOD: A multiple response predictive model for testing positive for HIV and having sufficient HIV knowledge is modeled to 2009 and 2018 survey data with the use of Bayes estimates. These data are obtained through a hierarchical data structure. The model allows one to address the change in the response to HIV, as it relates to morbidity and to HIV knowledge in Mozambique in the fight against the disease in the last decade. RESULTS: A more affluent resident is more likely to test positive, more likely to be more knowledgeable about the disease. Whereas, individuals practicing the Islam faith are less likely to test positive but also less likely to be knowledgeable about the disease. Education, while still a factor, has declined in its impact on testing positive for HIV or being knowledgeable about HIV. Females are more likely to test positive but more likely to be knowledgeable about the disease than men. The rate of impact of affluence on knowledge has increased in the past decade. Marital status (cohabitating or married) showed no impact on the knowledge of the disease. Age had no impact on knowledge suggesting that the message is getting to resident. CONCLUSIONS: A joint Bayes modeling of correlated binary (testing positive and knowledge about the disease) responses, while accounting for the hierarchy of the data collection, presents an opportunity to extract the extra variation before allocating the variation on the responses as the due of the covariates. The fight against HIV in Mozambique seems to be succeeding. Some knowledge is common among all ages, and Islam religion has a positive effect. While education still shows an influence on the binary responses, it has declined over the last decade.",,pubmed

Among women, it led to delayed sexual debut and reduced time between first sex and marriage by up to a year. Among men, risky sex, measured by the likelihood of concurrent sexual partnerships and paying for sex, increased. The increase in risky sex among men is likely to be due to the education reform's positive impact on income. The reform reduced the likelihood of HIV infection sharply among women, especially among relatively young women age 18-24. The impact on men's likelihood of HIV infection is uncertain.",,pubmed

SETTING: Complex sample survey designed to produce nationally representative estimates of behavioral and clinical characteristics of adults with diagnosed HIV in the United States. METHODS: We estimated the prevalence of having >/=1 diagnosed comorbidity associated with severe illness from COVID-19 and prevalence differences (PDs) by race/ethnicity, income level, and type of health insurance. We considered PDs >/=5 percentage points to be meaningful from a public health perspective. RESULTS: An estimated 37.9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 36.6 to 39.2] of adults receiving HIV care had >/=1 diagnosed comorbidity associated with severe illness from COVID-19. Compared with non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks or African Americans were more likely [adjusted PD, 7.8 percentage points (95% CI: 5.7 to 10.0)] and non-Hispanic Asians were less likely [adjusted PD, -13.7 percentage points (95% CI: -22.3 to -5.0)] to have >/=1 diagnosed comorbidity after adjusting for age differences. There were no meaningful differences between non-Hispanic Whites and adults in other racial/ethnic groups. Those with low income were more likely to have >/=1 diagnosed comorbidity [PD, 7.3 percentage points (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.4)]. CONCLUSIONS: Among adults receiving HIV care, non-Hispanic Blacks and those with low income were more likely to have >/=1 diagnosed comorbidity associated with severe COVID-19. Building health equity among people with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic may require reducing the impact of comorbidities in heavily affected communities.",,pubmed

However, the population-based incidence of NTM disease and NTM-TB coinfection remains unclear.We used Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database to identify new diagnoses of NTM disease and TB from 2005 to 2013 and calculated the incidence rate and the proportion of NTM-TB coinfection. The patients with NTM disease or TB were determined by the use of disease codes from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, laboratory mycobacterium examination codes, and antimycobacterial therapy receipts.From 2005 to 2013, the age-adjusted incidence rate of NTM disease increased from 5.3 to 14.8 per 100,000 people per year and the age-adjusted incidence rate of NTM-TB coinfection was around 1.2 to 2.2 per 100,000 people per year. The proportion of NTM-TB coinfection among patients with confirmed TB was 2.8%. Male and older patients had a significantly higher incidence of NTM disease. The effects of urbanization and socioeconomic status (SES) on the incidences of TB and NTM disease were different. Rural living and lower SES were significantly associated with increasing the incidence of confirmed TB but not with that of NTM disease. For NTM disease, those living in the least urbanized area had significantly lower incidence rate ratio than in the highest urbanized area. The incidence of NTM-TB coinfection was higher in older patients and compared with patients aged < 45 years, the incidence rate ratio of the patients aged> 74 years was 12.5.In TB-endemic Taiwan, the incidence of NTM disease increased from 2005 to 2013. Male gender and old age were risk factors for high incidence of NTM disease. SES did not have a significant effect on the incidence of NTM disease, but rural living was associated with lower incidence of NTM disease. In TB-endemic areas, NTM-TB coinfection could disturb the diagnosis of TB and treatment, especially in elderly patients.",,pubmed

However, challenges remain in eliminating HIV infections in key populations, including women working in entertainment establishments, such as massage parlors, karaoke bars, or beer gardens. This study explored the prevalence of HIV and identified factors associated with HIV infection among female entertainment workers (FEWs) in Cambodia. METHODS: This national biological and behavioral survey was conducted in 2016 in Phnom Penh and 17 provinces. We used a two-stage cluster sampling method to recruit FEWs for HIV testing performed on-site and face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. We investigated factors associated with HIV infection using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: This study included 3149 FEWs with a mean age of 26.2 years (SD 5.7). The adjusted prevalence of HIV was 3.2% (95% CI 1.76-5.75). In the multiple logistic regression model, the odds of HIV infection were significantly higher among FEWs in the age group of 31 to 35 (AOR 2.72, 95% CI 1.36-8.25) and 36 or older (AOR 3.62, 95% CI 1.89-10.55); FEWs who were not married but living with a sexual partner (AOR 3.00, 95% CI 1.16-7.79); FEWs who had at least ten years of formal education (AOR 0.32, 95% CI 0.17-0.83); FEWs who reported having abnormal vaginal discharge (AOR 3.51, 95% CI 1.12-9.01), genital ulcers or sores (AOR 2.06, 95% CI 1.09-3.17), and genital warts (AOR 2.89, 95% CI 1.44-6.33) in the past three months; and FEWs who reported using illicit drugs (AOR 3.28, 95% CI 1.20-4.27) than their respective reference group. The odds of HIV infection were significantly lower among FEWs working in karaoke bars (AOR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14-0.50) and beer gardens (AOR 0.17, 95% CI 0.09-0.54) than among freelance FEWs. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HIV among FEWs in Cambodia remains much higher than that in the general population. These findings indicate that differentiated strategies to address HIV and other sexually transmitted infections should be geared towards FEWs working as freelancers or in veiled entertainment venues such as massage parlors and freelance sex workers. Prevention efforts among venue-based FEWs should be sustained.",,pubmed

METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed medical records including socio-demographics, past medical history, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, treatment and disease outcome of 160 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 54 years (IQR: 38-64), and there was no significant gender difference (51% of male). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (55 [34%]), diabetes (31 [19%]) and obesity (13 [8%]). Fever (93 [58%]), cough (92 [57%]), fatigue (87 [54%]), shortness of breath (72 [45%]) and myalgia (33 [21%]) were the most common symptoms, upon admission. Patients were categorized into mild (92 [57%]), moderate (19 [12%]) and severe (49 [31%]). Severe patients were older and were more likely to have comorbidities, compared to mild ones. The majority of patients (92% [147 of 160]) patients received hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine phosphate. Regression model revealed that older age, lower SpO2, higher heart rate and elevated AST at admission were all risk factors associated with in-hospital death. The prevalence of COVID-19 and malaria co-infection was 0.63% and 70 (44%) of all patients received antimalarial treatment before hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that the epidemiological and clinical feature of COVID-19 patients in Kinshasa are broadly similar to previous reports from other settings. Older age, lower SpO2, tachycardia, and elevated AST could help to identify patients at higher risk of death at an early stage of the illness. Plasmodium spp co-infection was not common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.",,pubmed

In this case-control study, we compared socio-economic factors among Ethiopian ART recipients with lack of virological suppression to those with undetectable viral load (VL). METHODS: Cases (VL>1000 copies/ml) and controls (VL<150 copies/ml) aged >/=15years, with ART for >6 months and with available VL results within the last 3 months, were identified from registries at public ART clinics in Central Ethiopia. Questionnaire-based interviews on socio-economic characteristics, health condition and transmission risk behavior were conducted. Univariate variables associated with VL>1000 copies/ml (p<0.25) were added to a multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: Among 307 participants (155 cases, 152 controls), 61.2% were female, and the median age was 38 years (IQR 32-46). Median HIV-RNA load among cases was 6,904 copies/ml (IQR 2,843-26,789). Compared to controls, cases were younger (median 36 vs. 39 years; p = 0.004), more likely to be male (46.5% vs. 30.9%; p = 0.005) and had lower pre-ART CD4 cell counts (170 vs. 220 cells/mul; p = 0.009). In multivariable analysis of urban residents (94.8%), VL>1000 copies/ml was associated with lower relative wealth (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.98; 95% CI 1.49-5.94; p = 0.016), geographic work mobility (aOR 6.27, 95% CI 1.82-21.6; p = 0.016), younger age (aOR 0.94 [year], 95% CI 0.91-0.98; p = 0.011), longer duration of ART (aOR 1.19 [year], 95% CI 1.07-1.33; p = 0.020), and suboptimal (aOR 3.83, 95% CI 1.33-10.2; p = 0.048) or poor self-perceived wellbeing (aOR 9.75, 95% CI 2.85-33.4; p = 0.012), after correction for multiple comparisons. High-risk sexual behavior and substance use was not associated with lack of virological suppression. CONCLUSION: Geographic work mobility and lower relative wealth were associated with lack of virological suppression among Ethiopian ART recipients in this predominantly urban population. These characteristics indicate increased risk of treatment failure and the need for targeted interventions for persons with these risk factors.",,pubmed

HIV,"BACKGROUND: Whether HIV infection is associated with risk of death due to COVID-19 is unclear. We aimed to investigate this association in a large-scale population-based study in England. METHODS: We did a retrospective cohort study. Working on behalf of NHS England, we used the OpenSAFELY platform to analyse routinely collected electronic primary care data linked to national death registrations. We included all adults (aged >/=18 years) alive and in follow-up on Feb 1, 2020, and with at least 1 year of continuous registration with a general practitioner before this date. People with a primary care record for HIV infection were compared with people without HIV. The outcome was COVID-19 death, defined as the presence of International Classification of Diseases 10 codes U07.1 or U07.2 anywhere on the death certificate. Cox regression models were used to estimate the association between HIV infection and COVID-19 death; they were initially adjusted for age and sex, then we added adjustment for index of multiple deprivation and ethnicity, and then for a broad range of comorbidities. Interaction terms were added to assess effect modification by age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and calendar time. RESULTS: 17 282 905 adults were included, of whom 27 480 (0.16%) had HIV recorded. People living with HIV were more likely to be male, of Black ethnicity, and from a more deprived geographical area than the general population. 14 882 COVID-19 deaths occurred during the study period, with 25 among people with HIV. People living with HIV had higher risk of COVID-19 death than those without HIV after adjusting for age and sex: hazard ratio (HR) 2.90 (95% CI 1.96-4.30; p<0.0001). The association was attenuated, but risk remained high, after adjustment for deprivation, ethnicity, smoking and obesity: adjusted HR 2.59 (95% CI 1.74-3.84; p<0.0001). There was some evidence that the association was larger among people of Black ethnicity: HR 4.31 (95% CI 2.42-7.65) versus 1.84 (1.03-3.26) in non-Black individuals (p-interaction=0.044). INTERPRETATION: People with HIV in the UK seem to be at increased risk of COVID-19 mortality. Targeted policies should be considered to address this raised risk as the pandemic response evolves.

A cross-sectional study was conducted among 397 presumptive TB patients in a tertiary hospital in Myanmar. Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) questionnaire and AUDIT-C were used to measure daily tobacco use (single, any or dual use of smoked and smokeless tobacco) and harmful alcohol use, respectively. Multiple and multinomial logistic regression were used to examine the associations with socio-demographic factors. The prevalence of daily use of dual tobacco and any tobacco was 28.2% and 65.7%, respectively. Harmful alcohol use was also high (44.8%). While single use of daily tobacco and harmful alcohol was 28.2% and 7.3%, respectively, concurrent tobacco and alcohol use was 37.5%. While being male and having low education were associated with tobacco use, concurrent tobacco and harmful alcohol use were associated with male gender, low education, and occupation with the government or a company. Due to the high prevalence of tobacco and alcohol misuse, identifying those at risk of tobacco and alcohol misuse and providing integrated care services in a health facility should be considered as a joint activity in national TB and tobacco control programmes.",,pubmed

Patients with tuberculosis are not only more likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 but also likely to have adverse outcomes once infected. The sequelae of more severe forms of COVID-19 in patients who have recovered from TB but have residual compromised lung function, are also likely to be devastating. These diseases share almost identical bio-social determinants like poverty, overcrowding, diabetes and pollution and some clinical similarities. The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and our global response to it with lockdowns, are likely to leave a profound and long-lasting impact on TB diagnosis and control, potentially leading to an additional 6.3 million cases of TB between 2020 and 2025, and an additional 1.4 million TB deaths during this time. Novel solutions will need to be urgently devised or else TB control targets will never be met and indeed may be set back by 5-8 years.",,pubmed

The objective of this study was to determine the seroprevalence, entomological transmission indices, and socioeconomic risk factors associated with dengue in this region. A cross-sectional community-based study was conducted in four dengue-endemic sites; Khatmia, West Gash, Thoriba, and Shokriya between March 2016 to March 2017. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of immunoglobulin G (IgG) was used to determine the prevalence of dengue virus among the study participants. An entomological survey was conducted using pyrethrum spray catch and dipping for the collection of adults and aquatic stages of Aedes aegypti, respectively. Ribonucleic acid was extracted from the buffy coat of participants as well as from adult female Ae. aegypti to assess the possible circulation of dengue virus using Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Multiple logistic regression model was used to estimate the association between potential risk factors and dengue seropositivity. A total of 409 persons were recruited to the study: 45.5% were in the 20-39 years' age category; 57.9% were living in houses with 6-10 persons; and 29.1% had at most secondary school education. In the majority (65.8%) of the households, the socioeconomic status was low (P<0.001). Long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets were used in 56.5% of the households. Over three-quarters (77.8%) claimed not to have experienced febrile illness in the last three months. Routine entomological survey across Kassala state identified a total of 3,304 larvae and 390 pupae Ae. aegypti, respectively. The overall house index was 32.8% and Breteau Index was 35.96% (146/406). The overall pupal demographic index was 13.31%, and the pupal children index was 97.26%. Antibodies against IgG were detected from 66 (42.04%) out of a total of 157 sera. Twenty-two positive sera (75.9%) were collected from Khatmia. A total of 329 adults Ae. aegypti were identified but only one (0.3%) was positive for DENV in Khatmia. Finally, four independent risk factors were identified to derive dengue circulation in Kassala: elder age (> 60 years) (OR 6.31, CI 1.09-36.36); type of bathroom (OR 3.52, CI 1.35-9.20); using water-based air conditioner (OR 6.90, CI 1.78-26.85) and previous infection of any household member with dengue (OR 28.73, CI 3.31-249.63). Our findings suggest that Kassala state is facing an increasing occurrence of dengue and emphasizes the need for developing appropriate interventions to address the identified risk factors, and place control programs into actions. Establishment of routine dengue epidemiological and entomological surveillance, and climate warning systems will contribute to early warning and timely detection and response to emerging outbreaks.",,pubmed

METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data collected in the UK Prognostic Evaluation of Diagnostic Interferon-Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs) Consortium Study which enrolled 9176 recent tuberculosis (TB) contacts and migrants at National Health Service (NHS) facilities and community settings in the UK. The study outcome was LTBI (positive IGRA test (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube or T-SPOT.TB)). The main exposures were history of smoking, history of substance misuse, homelessness, prison stay and socioeconomic deprivation. RESULTS: 4914 (56.2%) individuals resided in the most deprived areas and 2536 (27.6%) had LTBI. In the multivariable analysis (adjusting for age, gender, place of birth, ethnicity, HIV status, BCG vaccination and recent TB contact) living in the least deprived areas compared with living in the most deprived areas was associated with reduced odds of LTBI (odds ratio (OR)=0.68, 95% CI: 0.51 to 0.90) while ever been homeless (OR=1.50, 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.21) was associated with increased odds of LTBI. Smoking, homelessness and substance misuse were not associated with LTBI. CONCLUSION: Social deprivation could be an important risk factor for LTBI, highlighting the social inequality in the burden of TB infection in the UK. Migrants and TB contacts who were socially deprived or homeless were at a significantly higher risk for LTBI, thus tailored intense public health interventions to these groups may help to reduce the risk of future TB disease.

A352,Trends in Premature Deaths among Women Living with HIV/AIDS and Cervical Cancer.,10.14423/SMJ.0000000000001184,Oduguwa E; Dongarwar D; Salihu HM,2020.0,Southern medical journal,"OBJECTIVES: There is a lack of updated information on premature death and years of potential life lost (YPLL) among human immunodeficiency (HIV)-positive women with cervical cancer. We hypothesize that increased access to preventive resources such as antiretroviral therapy, preexposure prophylaxis, and human papillomavirus vaccines has reduced premature mortality and YPLL in these women in the previous decades. METHODS: We used data from the National Inpatient Sample database from 2003 to the third quarter of 2015, and restricted the analysis to HIV-positive women with or without cervical cancer. Joinpoint regression models were run to identify trends in the rates of HIV and cervical cancer. Overall and age-stratified YPLL were calculated for HIV-positive women with cervical cancer. Adjusted survey logistic regression models were built to determine the predictive factors of in-hospital mortality among women living with HIV. RESULTS: Among hospitalized women, low-income, non-Hispanic Blacks, and patients aged 40 to 59 years experienced greater frequencies of HIV/cervical cancer comorbidity. The prevalence of HIV hospitalizations increased by an average annual percentage of 0.9% (95% confidence interval 0.3-1.6). YPLL decreased in HIV-positive women living with and without cervical cancer by 4.9% and 4.3%, respectively. The trajectory for YPLL was not uniform across age groups. YPLL decreased substantially in women aged 20 to 29 years with HIV/cervical cancer comorbidity. Cervical cancer remained a significant predictor of mortality among HIV-positive women when adjusted for age, race, and insurance coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Within a large, national sample from 2003 to 2015, we found an overall declining trend in YPLL in women living with HIV/cervical cancer comorbidity. In-hospital mortality among HIV-positive women was associated with cervical cancer, age, race, and insurance coverage. We recommend further investigation into the quality of HIV and cervical cancer treatment and prevention services for the sociodemographic groups described.",,pubmed

However, its prevalence and risk factors among adults living with PTB patients are poorly documented in Kenya. OBJECTIVE: to determine the prevalence and risk factors for LTBI among adult HHCs of PTB patients in Kenya. METHODS: this was an analytical cross-sectional study of HHCs of PTB patients in Nairobi, Kenya. Socio-demographic data was captured on questionnaires and blood samples drawn for Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) quantification. Univariate and multivariate analyses using the Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS) was used to determine the prevalence of LTBI and risk factors at 95% Confidence Interval (CI). RESULTS: a total of 166 PTB patients yielded 175 HHCs of whom 29.7% (52/125) were males and 70.3% (123/125) were females. A majority of HHCs [65.7% (115/175)] lived in a single-room house with the patient and [37.7% (66/175)] were in the age group 30-39-years. The overall prevalence of LTBI was 55.7%, peaking among spouses of the patients [70.0% (14/20) and the 30-39 year age group [63.5% (42/66)]. Potential risk factors for LTBI included cohabiting with a PTB patient for 8 to 12 weeks [OR = 3.6 (0.70-18.5), p = 0.107], being a spouse of the patient [OR = 2.0 (0.72-5.47), p = 0.173] and sharing a single room with the patient [OR = 1.58 (0.84 - 2.97), p = 0.158]. CONCLUSION: the high prevalence of LTBI among adult HHCs of PTB patients in this population demonstrates the need for targeted contact-screening programs in high TB transmission settings.",,pubmed

We describe a rare case of a patient with pre-existing M184V/I mutation and virological failure on a dolutegravir/lamivudine/abacavir regimen with the emergence of integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance mutations. Additional risk factors, which may have triggered the virological failure, included suboptimal adherence and low nadir CD4+ cell count. This case illustrates that dolutegravir-containing triple-therapy should be prescribed with caution to patients with pre-existing M184V/I mutation and poor efficacy of the reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone. In addition, this case highlights the need for viral load monitoring in patients on dolutegravir-containing regimens in settings with a high prevalence of the M184V/I mutation such as in low-income countries.",,pubmed

The aim of this study was to analyze risk factors for COVID-19 prevalence and deaths in all 6 geopolitical regions and 37 States in Nigeria. METHODS: we analyzed the data retrieved from various sources, including Nigeria CDC, Nigeria National Bureau of Statistics, Unicef-Nigeria multiple indicator cluster survey and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington. We examined 4 clinical risk factors (prevalence of TB, HIV, smoking and BCG vaccination coverage) and 5 sociodemographic factors (age >/=65, population density, literacy rate, unemployment and GDP per capita). Multivariate modeling was conducted using generalized linear model. RESULTS: our analysis showed that the incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases differed widely across the 37 States, from 0.09 per 100,000 in Kogi to 83.7 in Lagos. However, more than 70% of confirmed cases were concentrated in just 7 States: Lagos, Abuja, Oyo, Kano, Edo, Rivers and Delta. Case mortality rate (CMR) also varied considerably, with Lagos, Abuja and Edo having CMR above 9 per million population. On bivariate analysis, higher CMR correlated positively with GDP (r=0.53) and to a lesser extent with TB (r=0.36) and population density (r=0.38). On multivariate analysis, which is more definitive, States with higher HIV prevalence and BCG coverage had lower CMR, while high GDP States had a greater CMR. CONCLUSION: this study indicates that COVID-19 has disproportionately affected certain States in Nigeria.

A356,Childhood Asthma: Low and Middle-Income Countries Perspective.,10.5644/ama2006-124.296,Soto-Martinez ME; Soto-Quiros ME; Custovic A,2020.0,Acta medica academica,"Our aim is to review current asthma epidemiology, achievements from the last 10 years, and persistent challenges of asthma management and control in low-middle income countries (LMICs). Despite global efforts, asthma continues to be an important public health problem worldwide, particularly in poorly resourced settings. Several epidemiological studies in the last decades have shown significant variability in the prevalence of asthma globally, but generally a marked increase in LMICs resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Poverty, air pollution, climate change, exposure to indoor allergens, urbanization and diet are some of the factors that contribute to inadequate control and poor outcomes in developing countries. Although asthma guidelines have been developed to raise awareness and improve asthma diagnosis and treatment, problems with underdiagnosis and undertreatment are still common. In addition, important social, financial, cultural and healthcare barriers are common obstacles in LMICs in achieving control. Given the high burden of asthma in these countries, adaptation and implementation of national asthma guidelines tailored to local needs should be a public health priority. Governmental commitment, education, better health system infrastructure, access to care and effective asthma medications are the cornerstone of achieving success. CONCLUSION: Asthma poses significant challenges to LMICs. Whilst there are ongoing efforts in improving asthma diagnosis and decreasing asthma burden in LMICs; reasons for inadequate asthma control are also common and difficult to tackle. Improving asthma diagnosis, access to appropriate treatment and decreasing risk factors should be key goals to reduce asthma morbidity and mortality worldwide.",,pubmed

A359,Geostatistical analysis and mapping of malaria risk in children of Mozambique.,10.1371/journal.pone.0241680,Ejigu BA,2020.0,PloS one,"Malaria remains one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in the tropics and subtropics, and Mozambique is not an exception. To design geographically targeted and effective intervention mechanisms of malaria, an up-to-date map that shows the spatial distribution of malaria is needed. This study analyzed 2018 Mozambique Malaria Indicator Survey using geostatistical methods to: i) explore individual, household, and community-level determinants of malaria in under-five children, ii) prepare a malaria prevalence map in Mozambique, and iii) produce prediction prevalence maps and exceedence probability across the country. The results show the overall weighted prevalence of malaria was 38.9% (N = 4347, with 95% CI: 36.9%-40.8%). Across different provinces of Mozambique, the prevalence of malaria ranges from 1% in Maputo city to 57.3% in Cabo Delgado province. Malaria prevalence was found to be higher in rural areas, increased with child's age, and decreased with household wealth index and mother's level of education. Given the high prevalence of childhood malaria observed in Mozambique there is an urgent need for effective public health interventions in malaria hot spot areas. The household determinants of malaria infection that are identified in this study as well as the maps of parasitaemia risk could be used by malaria control program implementers to define priority intervention areas.",,pubmed

Infection with helminths and intestinal protozoa cause considerable morbidity. The aim of this study was to assess the health status of schoolchildren in nine villages of the Kilombero district in Tanzania. We conducted a cross-sectional survey and subjected 427 children aged 6-12 years to standardized diagnostic tests. We found that 15% of children were infected with Entamoeba histolytica/Entamoeba dispar/Entamoeba moshkovskii, 12% with Schistosoma mansoni, and 5% with Plasmodium falciparum. The most common soil-transmitted helminth species was Trichuris trichiura (7%). Strongyloides stercoralis, Schistosoma haematobium, Giardia intestinalis and lymphatic filariasis were rare. Having a latrine inside the house was associated with a lower odds of parasite infections (odds ratio (OR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27-0.96, p = 0.04). Children from households with goats were at higher odds of E. histolytica/E. dispar/E. moshkovskii infection (OR 3.03, 95%%CI 1.29-7.10, p = 0.01).When compared to a cross-sectional survey conducted in the same district in the 1980s, there seems to have been a substantial reduction in the prevalence and intensity of parasitic infections, except for T. trichiura, which showed a similar prevalence. Our data suggest that the general development, coupled with infectious disease control programmes improved children's health markedly. However, continued efforts to control parasitic diseases, including new approaches of drug combinations, stronger intersectoral collaboration, rigorous surveillance and public health responses tailored to the local settings are needed to move from control to elimination.",,pubmed

The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) receipt, TANF sanctions, and economic hardship (EH) on SAVA syndemic conditions that included indicators of substance use, HIV risk-taking behaviors, and intimate partner violence among mothers over time. METHODS: Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (n = 4,898), we investigated the longitudinal measurement invariance of a proposed measure of syndemic conditions among mothers over five waves and performed path analysis to investigate the relationships between TANF use, TANF sanctions, and EH with syndemic conditions. RESULTS: Analyses revealed the presence of SAVA syndemic conditions and EH predicted increased SAVA in subsequent waves. Relationships between reported race of the mother and the sanctioning of TANF benefits and increased SAVA were also noted. CONCLUSIONS: This study has implications regarding race, welfare policy and sanctioning practices, and the socioeconomic determinants of health that drive syndemic conditions among mothers in the United States.",,pubmed
A362,Risk screening methods for extreme heat: Implications for equity-oriented adaptation.,10.1371/journal.pone.0240841,Turek-Hankins LL; Hino M; Mach KJ,2020.0,PloS one,"Morbidity and mortality impacts of extreme heat amplified by climate change will be unequally distributed among communities given pre-existing differences in socioeconomic, health, and environmental conditions. Many governments are interested in adaptation policies that target those especially vulnerable to the risks, but there are important questions about how to effectively identify and support communities most in need of heat adaptations. Here, we use an equity-oriented adaptation program from the state of California as a case study to evaluate the implications of the currently used environmental justice index (CalEnviroScreen 3.0) for the identification of socially vulnerable communities with climate change adaptation needs. As CalEnviroScreen is geared towards air and water pollution, we assess how community heat risks and adaptation needs would be evaluated differently under two more adaptation-relevant vulnerability indices: the Social Vulnerability Index and the Heat-Health Action Index. Our analysis considers communities at the census tract scale, as well as the patterns emerging at the regional scale. Using the current index, the state designates 25% of its census tracts as ""disadvantaged"" communities eligible for special adaptation funds. However, an additional 12.6% of the state's communities could be considered vulnerable if the two other indices were considered instead. Only 13.4% of communities are vulnerable across all three vulnerability indices studied. Choice of vulnerability index shapes statewide trends in extreme heat risk and is linked to a community's likelihood of receiving heat-related California Climate Investments (CCI) projects. Tracts that are vulnerable under the current pollution-focused index, but not under the heat-health specific index, received four times the number of heat-related interventions as tracts vulnerable under the reverse scenario. This study demonstrates important nuances relevant to implementing equity-oriented adaptation and explores the challenges, trade-offs, and opportunities in quantifying vulnerability.",,pubmed

The Northeast region of Brazil is characterized by having one of the highest dengue rates in the country, in addition to being considered the poorest region. Here, we aimed to identify spatial clusters with the highest dengue risk, as well as to analyze the temporal behavior of the incidence rate and the effects of social determinants on the disease transmission dynamic in Northeastern Brazil. METHODS: This is an ecological study carried out with all confirmed cases of dengue in the Northeast Brazil between 2014 and 2017. Data were extracted from the National Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Local empirical Bayesian model, Moran statistics and spatial scan statistics were applied. The association between dengue incidence rate and social determinants was tested using Moran's bivariate correlation. RESULTS: A total of 509 261 cases of dengue were confirmed in the Northeast during the study period, 53.41% of them were concentrated in Pernambuco and Ceara states. Spatial analysis showed a heterogeneous distribution of dengue cases in the region, with the highest rates in the east coast. Four risk clusters were observed, involving 815 municipalities (45.45%). Moreover, social indicators related to population density, education, income, housing, and social vulnerability showed a spatial correlation with the dengue incidence rate. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides information on the spatial dynamics of dengue in northeastern Brazil and its relationship with social determinants and can be used in the formulation of public health policies to reduce the impact of the disease in vulnerable populations.",,pubmed

This infectious disease remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality among children in Rwanda. The main objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of malaria among children aged six months to 14 years old in Rwanda and to identify the factors associated with malaria in this age group. This study used data from the 2017 Rwanda Malaria Indicator Survey. Due to the complex design used in sampling, a survey logistic regression model was used to fit the data and the outcome variable was the presence or absence of malaria. This study considered 8209 children in the analysis and the prevalence of malaria was 14.0%. This rate was higher among children aged 5-9 years old (15.6%), compared to other age groups. Evidently, the prevalence of malaria was also higher among children from poor families (19.4%) compared to children from the richest families (4.3%). The prevalence of malaria was higher among children from rural households (16.2%) compared to children from urban households (3.4%). The results revealed that other significant factors associated with malaria were: the gender of the child, the number of household members, whether the household had mosquito bed nets for sleeping, whether the dwelling had undergone indoor residual spraying in the 12 months prior to the survey, the location of the household's source of drinking water, the main wall materials of the dwelling, and the age of the head of the household. The prevalence of malaria was also high among children living in houses with walls built from poorly suited materials; this suggests the need for intervention in construction materials. Further, it was found that the Eastern Province also needs special consideration in malaria control due to the higher prevalence of the disease among its residents, compared to those in other provinces.",,pubmed

Whereas prior work has demonstrated implementations for binary exposures and continuous outcomes, use of parametric g-computation has been limited due to difficulty in implementation in more typical complex scenarios. METHODS: We provide an easy-to-implement algorithm for parametric g-computation in the setting of a dynamic baseline intervention of a baseline exposure and a time-to-event outcome. To demonstrate the use of our algorithm, we apply it to estimate the effects of interventions to reduce area deprivation on the cumulative incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs: gonorrhea, chlamydia or trichomoniasis) among women living with HIV in the Women's Interagency HIV Study. RESULTS: We found that reducing area deprivation by a maximum of 1 tertile for all women would lead to a 2.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.1%, 4.3%] reduction in 4-year STI incidence, and reducing deprivation by a maximum of 2 tertiles would lead to a 4.3% (95% CI: 1.9%, 6.4%) reduction. CONCLUSIONS: As analytic methods such as parametric g-computation become more accessible, epidemiologists will be able to estimate policy-relevant effects of interventions to better inform clinical and public health practice and policy.",,pubmed

Household contacts of leprosy cases are at increased risk of leprosy development. Identification of household contacts at highest risk would optimize this process. METHODS: The temporal pattern of new case presentation amongst household contacts was documented in the COCOA (Contact Cohort Analysis) study. The COCOA study actively examined household contacts of confirmed leprosy index cases identified in 1995, and 2000-2014, to provide evidence for timings of contact examination policies. Data was available on 9527 index cases and 38303 household contacts. 666 household contacts were diagnosed with leprosy throughout the follow-up (maximum follow-up of 21 years). Risk factors for leprosy development within the data analysed, were identified using Cox proportional hazard regression. FINDINGS: The dominant risk factor for household contacts developing leprosy was having a highly skin smear positive index case in the household. As the grading of initial slit skin smear of the index case increased from negative to high positive (4-6), the hazard of their associated household contacts developing leprosy increases by 3.14 times (p<0.001). Being a blood relative was not a risk factor, no gender differences in susceptibility were found. INTERPRETATION: We found a dominance of a single variable predicting risk for leprosy transmission-skin smear positive index cases. A small number of cases are maintaining transmission in the household setting. Focus should be performing contact examinations on these households and detecting new skin smear positive index cases. Conducting slit-skin smears on new cases is needed for predicting risk; such services need supporting. If skin smear positive cases are sustaining leprosy infection within the household setting, the administration of single-dose rifampicin (SDR) to household contacts as the sole intervention in Bangladesh will not be effective.",,pubmed

However, the conditions faced by specific populations vary according to social, structural and environmental factors, including stigma and discrimination, criminalization, social and economic safety nets and the local epidemiology of HIV and COVID-19, which determine risk of exposure and vulnerability to adverse health outcomes, as well as the ability to comply with measures such as physical distancing. This commentary identifies common vulnerabilities and cross-cutting themes in terms of the impacts of COVID-19 on key populations before addressing issues and concerns specific to particular populations. DISCUSSION: Cross-cutting themes include direct impacts such as disrupted access to essential medicines, commodities and services such as anti-retroviral treatment, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, opioid agonist treatment, viral load monitoring, HIV and sexually transmitted infections testing, condoms and syringes. Indirect impacts include significant collateral damage arising from prevention measures which restrict human rights, increase or impose criminal penalties, and expand police powers to target vulnerable and criminalized populations. Significant heterogeneity in the COVID-19 pandemic, the underlying HIV epidemic and the ability of key populations to protect themselves means that people who inject drugs and sex workers face particular challenges, including indirect impacts as a result of police targeting, loss of income and sometimes both. Geographical variations mean that transgender people and men who have sex with men in regions like Africa and the middle east remain criminalized, as well as stigmatized and discriminated against, increasing their vulnerability to adverse outcomes in relation to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Disruptions to both licit and illicit supply chains, loss of income and livelihoods and changes in behaviour as a result of lockdowns and physical distancing have the potential to exacerbate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on key populations. While these impacts will vary significantly, human-rights approaches to COVID-19 emergency laws and public health prevention measures that are population-specific and sensitive, will be key to reducing adverse health outcomes and ensuring that no one is left behind.",,pubmed

This study examined organizational and intrapersonal factors contributing to psychological health during COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected via online anonymous surveys from 1029 HIV healthcare providers in Guangxi, China during April-May 2020. Path analysis was utilized to test a mediation model among COVID-19 stressors, institutional support, resilience, and psychological distress (PHQ-4). Thirty-eight percent of the providers experienced psychological distress (PHQ-4 score > 3).

Pre-treatment delay is a hindrance in reducing this burden by early diagnosis and prompt treatment of TB. The study was conducted to identify the patient factors related to pre-treatment delay of pulmonary TB. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was performed during January to June 2018 in a cohort of 240 consecutively enrolled; newly detected adult pulmonary TB (PTB) patients initiated anti-TB therapy during the study period. Two DOTS were selected randomly using cluster sampling and all the PTB patients enrolled in the DOTS centres formed the study population. Informed written consent was obtained from the patients, prior to data collection. Data were collected by face-to-face interview and reviewing medical records using a semi-structured questionnaire and checklist respectively. RESULTS: Age of the patients was associated with pre-treatment delay of TB (p < 0.05) with predominance in elderly (75.0%). Delay in care seeking was associated with inability to make decision (RR = 1.84; AR: 35.84%) and awareness of patients (RR = 0.33; AR = -40.0%). Delay in diagnosis was associated with economic problem (RR: 1.63; AR: 28.85%); work barrier (RR: 1.75; AR: 35.03%); inability to make decision (RR: 1.93; AR: 40.65%); delayed investigation (RR: 2.88; AR: 56.17%); others' assistance (RR: 1.77; AR: 28.53%); and symptomatic treatment (RR: 6.43; AR: 65.14%). Delay in treatment initiation was associated with repeated investigations (RR = 1.52; AR: 23.29%) and smear positivity (RR: 0.64; AR: 23.11%). Awareness of patients regarding symptoms and smear positivity were revealed as protective factors for pre-treatment delay of TB. CONCLUSION: Delay in care seeking, diagnosis, and treatment initiation contribute substantially to pre-treatment delay of PTB. Considerable reduction in pre-treatment delay may be achieved through changes in awareness of patients and ensuring early diagnosis and prompt treatment of PTB under DOTS programme.",,pubmed

Today the malaria burden is increasingly concentrated in a few countries, including Burkina Faso, where malaria is not declining. A cohort study was conducted to identify risk factors for malaria infection in children in southwest Burkina Faso, an area with high insecticide-treated net (ITN) coverage and insecticide-resistant vectors. METHODS: Incidence of Plasmodium falciparum infection was measured in 252 children aged 5 to 15 years, using active and passive detection, during the 2017 transmission season, following clearance of infection. Demographic, socio-economic, environmental, and entomological risk factors, including use of ITNs and insecticide resistance were monitored. RESULTS: During the six-month follow-up period, the overall incidence of P. falciparum infection was 2.78 episodes per child (95% CI = 2.66-2.91) by microscopy, and 3.11 (95% CI = 2.95-3.28) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The entomological inoculation rate (EIR) was 80.4 infective bites per child over the six-month malaria transmission season. At baseline, 80.6% of children were reported as sleeping under an ITN the previous night, although at the last survey, 23.3% of nets were in poor condition and considered no longer protective. No association was found between the rate of P. falciparum infection and either EIR (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.00, 95% CI: 1.00-1.00, p = 0.08) or mortality in WHO tube tests when vectors were exposed to 0.05% deltamethrin (IRR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.73-1.50, p = 0.79). Travel history (IRR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.45-1.59, p < 0.001) and higher socio-economic status were associated with an increased risk of P. falciparum infection (IRR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00-1.11, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of P. falciparum infection remains overwhelmingly high in the study area. The study findings suggest that because of the exceptionally high levels of malaria transmission in the study area, malaria elimination cannot be achieved solely by mass deployment of ITNs and additional control measures are needed.",,pubmed

Despite a safe renal profile in the clinical trials, long-term use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) has been associated with proximal renal tubulopathy although the underlying mechanisms remain undetermined. We aim to establish the prevalence of and risk factors for TDF-induced kidney tubular dysfunction (KTD) among HIV-I and II individuals treated with TDF in south-west Nigeria. Association between TDF-induced KTD and genetic polymorphisms in renal drug transporter genes and the APOL1 (Apolipoprotein L1) gene will be examined. METHODS: This study has two phases. An initial cross-sectional study will screen 3000 individuals attending the HIV clinics in south-west Nigeria for KTD to determine the prevalence and risk factors. This will be followed by a case-control study of 400 KTD cases and 400 matched controls to evaluate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations. Data on socio-demographics, risk factors for kidney dysfunction and HIV history will be collected by questionnaire. Blood and urine samples for measurements of severity of HIV disease (CD4 count, viral load) and renal function (creatinine, eGFR, phosphate, uric acid, glucose) will also be collected. Utility of urinary retinol binding protein (RBP) and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) levels as surrogate markers of KTD will be evaluated. Genomic DNA will be extracted from whole blood and SNP analyses performed using the rhAMP SNP genotyping assays. Statistical analysis including univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses will be performed to identify factors associated with KTD. DISCUSSION: In spite of TDF being the most commonly used antiretroviral agent and a key component of many HIV treatment regimens, it has potential detrimental effects on the kidneys. This study will establish the burden and risk factors for TDF-induced KTD in Nigerians, and explore associations between KTD and polymorphisms in renal transporter genes as well as APOL1 risk variants. This study may potentially engender an approach for prevention as well as stemming the burden of CKD in sub-Saharan Africa where GDP per capita is low and budgetary allocation for health is inadequate.",,pubmed

Accurate diagnostics as well as the ability to identify contacts at high risk of infection are essential for ACF, and have not been systematically reported from Central Asia. The objective was to implement a pilot ACF program to determine the prevalence and risk factors for LTBI and active TB among contacts of individuals with TB in Kyrgyz Republic using Quantiferon-TB Gold plus (QuantiFERON). METHODS: An enhanced ACF project in the Kyrgyz Republic was implemented in which close and household (home) contacts of TB patients from the Issyk-Kul Oblast TB Center were visited at home. QuantiFERON and the tuberculin skin test (TST) alongside clinical and bacteriological examination were used to identify LTBI and active TB cases among contacts. The association for QuantiFERON positivity and risk factors were analysed and compared to TST results. RESULTS: Implementation of ACF with QuantiFERON involved close collaboration with the national sanitary and epidemiological services (SES) and laboratories in the Kyrgyz Republic. From 67 index cases, 296 contacts were enrolled of whom 253 had QuantiFERON or TST results; of those 103 contacts had LTBI (positive TST or IGRA), and four (1.4%) active TB cases were detected. Index case smear microscopy (OR 1.76) and high household density (OR 1.97) were significant risk factors for QuantiFERON positivity for all contacts. When stratified by age, association with smear positivity disappeared for children below 15 years. TST was not associated with any risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first time that ACF activities have been reported for Central Asia, and provide insight for implementation of effective ACF in the region. These ACF activities using QuantiFERON led to increase in the detection of LTBI and active cases, prior to patients seeking treatment. Household density should be taken into consideration as an important risk factor for the stratification of future ACF activities.",,pubmed

We sought to assess and, if needed, enhance a risk assessment tool from the VOICE trial for identifying AGYW at high risk for HIV in Lilongwe, Malawi. METHODS: A multisite prospective cohort study was conducted among sexually active AGYW 15 to 24 years old at 4 health centers in 2016 to 2017. The VOICE tool was first applied and then updated by excluding variables that were not predictive and adding variables that were. Incidence rates (IRs), incidence rate ratios, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. RESULTS: Seven hundred ninety-five participants experienced 14 seroconversions for 672 PYs (IR, 2.08 per 100 PYs; 95% CI, 1.23-3.52). The VOICE tool had moderate predictive ability (AUC, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52-0.75). Maintaining 2 variables (genital ulcers and vaginal discharge), removing 5 sociodemographic variables, and adding 2 variables (ever pregnant and >5-year male-female age gap) enhanced performance (AUC, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69-0.89). Thirty-five percent had a score of 0, 41% had a score of 1 to 2, and 24% had a score >3. A score >1 resulted in 100% sensitivity, 35.9% specificity, and an IR of 3.25 per 100 PYs.

However, little is known about socioeconomic disparities in vulnerability to heat. We aimed to evaluate whether there were socioeconomic disparities in vulnerability to heat-related all-cause and cause-specific hospitalization among Brazilian cities. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We collected daily hospitalization and weather data in the hot season (city-specific 4 adjacent hottest months each year) during 2000-2015 from 1,814 Brazilian cities covering 78.4% of the Brazilian population. A time-stratified case-crossover design modeled by quasi-Poisson regression and a distributed lag model was used to estimate city-specific heat-hospitalization association. Then meta-analysis was used to synthesize city-specific estimates according to different socioeconomic quartiles or levels. We included 49 million hospitalizations (58.5% female; median [interquartile range] age: 33.3 [19.8-55.7] years). For cities of lower middle income (LMI), upper middle income (UMI), and high income (HI) according to the World Bank's classification, every 5 degrees C increase in daily mean temperature during the hot season was associated with a 5.1% (95% CI 4.4%-5.7%, P < 0.001), 3.7% (3.3%-4.0%, P < 0.001), and 2.6% (1.7%-3.4%, P < 0.001) increase in all-cause hospitalization, respectively. The inter-city socioeconomic disparities in the association were strongest for children and adolescents (0-19 years) (increased all-cause hospitalization risk with every 5 degrees C increase [95% CI]: 9.9% [8.7%-11.1%], P < 0.001, in LMI cities versus 5.2% [4.1%-6.3%], P < 0.001, in HI cities). The disparities were particularly evident for hospitalization due to certain diseases, including ischemic heart disease (increase in cause-specific hospitalization risk with every 5 degrees C increase [95% CI]: 5.6% [-0.2% to 11.8%], P = 0.060, in LMI cities versus 0.5% [-2.1% to 3.1%], P = 0.717, in HI cities), asthma (3.7% [0.3%-7.1%], P = 0.031, versus -6.4% [-12.1% to -0.3%], P = 0.041), pneumonia (8.0% [5.6%-10.4%], P < 0.001, versus 3.8% [1.1%-6.5%], P = 0.005), renal diseases (9.6% [6.2%-13.1%], P < 0.001, versus 4.9% [1.8%-8.0%], P = 0.002), mental health conditions (17.2% [8.4%-26.8%], P < 0.001, versus 5.5% [-1.4% to 13.0%], P = 0.121), and neoplasms (3.1% [0.7%-5.5%], P = 0.011, versus -0.1% [-2.1% to 2.0%], P = 0.939). The disparities were similar when stratifying the cities by other socioeconomic indicators (urbanization rate, literacy rate, and household income). The main limitations were lack of data on personal exposure to temperature, and that our city-level analysis did not assess intra-city or individual-level socioeconomic disparities and could not exclude confounding effects of some unmeasured variables. CONCLUSIONS: Less developed cities displayed stronger associations between heat exposure and all-cause hospitalizations and certain types of cause-specific hospitalizations in Brazil. This may exacerbate the existing geographical health and socioeconomic inequalities under a changing climate.",,pubmed

However, many aspects of dengue epidemiology remain unclear; in particular, the relationship between Aedes vector abundance and dengue transmission risk. This study aims to identify entomological and immunological indices capable of discriminating between dengue case and control (non-case) houses, based on the assessment of candidate indices, as well as individual and household characteristics, as potential risk factors for acquiring dengue infection. METHODS: This prospective, hospital-based, case-control study was conducted in northeastern Thailand between June 2016 and August 2019. Immature and adult stage Aedes were collected at the houses of case and control patients, recruited from district hospitals, and at patients' neighboring houses. Blood samples were tested by RDT and PCR to detect dengue cases, and were processed with the Nterm-34 kDa salivary peptide to measure the human immune response to Aedes bites. Socioeconomic status, and other individual and household characteristics were analyzed as potential risk factors for dengue. RESULTS: Study findings showed complex relationships between entomological indices and dengue risk. The presence of DENV-infected Aedes at the patient house was associated with 4.2-fold higher odds of dengue. On the other hand, Aedes presence (irrespective of infectious status) in the patient's house was negatively associated with dengue. In addition, the human immune response to Aedes bites, was higher in control than in case patients and Aedes adult abundance and immature indices were higher in control than in case houses at the household and the neighboring level. Multivariable analysis showed that children aged 10-14 years old and those aged 15-25 years old had respectively 4.5-fold and 2.9-fold higher odds of dengue infection than those older than 25 years. CONCLUSION: DENV infection in female Aedes at the house level was positively associated with dengue infection, while adult Aedes presence in the household was negatively associated. This study highlights the potential benefit of monitoring dengue viruses in Aedes vectors. Our findings suggest that monitoring the presence of DENV-infected Aedes mosquitoes could be a better indicator of dengue risk than the traditional immature entomological indices.",,pubmed

We describe the places in which African American and Latinx MSM interviewees live and socialize, and how these places influence sexual behavior, drug use, and access to health care. We find common spatial patterns in mobility, incongruence in residential and sexual places, and differing geographic patterns of sex by men who use geo-social hook-up apps. Significant instability in home life and varying forms of mobility and risk-taking were a response to cumulative disadvantage and intersecting structural forces including poverty, racism, and homophobia. Our results strongly suggest that geographic mobility is a syndemic factor for HIV risk among MSM in Los Angeles, as mobility amplified negative impacts of other syndemic factors. Innovative place-interventions to reduce HIV incidence and disparities in HIV need to acknowledge the synergistic factors that drive higher HIV incidence among AA and Latinx MSM.",,pubmed

Knowledge of risk factors associated with malaria infections is growing globally, but these associations remain understudied across Madagascar's diverse ecosystems experiencing rapid environmental change. This study aims to uncover socioeconomic, demographic, and ecological risk factors for malaria infection across regions through analysis of a large, cross-sectional dataset. METHODS: The objectives were to assess (1) the ecological correlates of malaria vector breeding through larval surveys, and (2) the socioeconomic, demographic, and ecological risk factors for malaria infection in four ecologically distinct regions of rural Madagascar. Risk factors were determined using multilevel models for the four regions included in the study. RESULTS: The presence of aquatic agriculture (both within and surrounding communities) is the strongest predictive factor of habitats containing Anopheles larvae across all regions. Ecological and socioeconomic risk factors for malaria infection vary dramatically across study regions and range in their complexity. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for malaria transmission differ dramatically across regions of Madagascar. These results may help stratifying current malaria control efforts in Madagascar beyond the scope of existing interventions.",,pubmed

Key risk factors include poverty, low education, violence, alcohol and drug use, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and stigma and discrimination. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the prevalence of mental health problems among FSWs in LMICs, and to examine associations with common risk factors. METHOD AND FINDINGS: The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016049179. We searched 6 electronic databases for peer-reviewed, quantitative studies from inception to 26 April 2020. Study quality was assessed with the Centre for Evidence-Based Management (CEBM) Critical Appraisal Tool. Pooled prevalence estimates were calculated for depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidal behaviour. Meta-analyses examined associations between these disorders and violence, alcohol/drug use, condom use, and HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI). A total of 1,046 studies were identified, and 68 papers reporting on 56 unique studies were eligible for inclusion. These were geographically diverse (26 countries), representing all LMIC regions, and included 24,940 participants. All studies were cross-sectional and used a range of measurement tools; none reported a mental health intervention. Of the 56 studies, 14 scored as strong quality, 34 scored as moderate, and 8 scored as weak. The average age of participants was 28.9 years (age range: 11-64 years), with just under half (46%) having up to primary education or less. The pooled prevalence rates for mental disorders among FSWs in LMICs were as follows: depression 41.8% (95% CI 35.8%-48.0%), anxiety 21.0% (95% CI: 4.8%-58.4%), PTSD 19.7% (95% CI 3.2%-64.6%), psychological distress 40.8% (95% CI 20.7%-64.4%), recent suicide ideation 22.8% (95% CI 13.2%-36.5%), and recent suicide attempt 6.3% (95% CI 3.4%-11.4%). Meta-analyses found significant associations between violence experience and depression, violence experience and recent suicidal behaviour, alcohol use and recent suicidal behaviour, illicit drug use and depression, depression and inconsistent condom use with clients, and depression and HIV infection. Key study limitations include a paucity of longitudinal studies (necessary to assess causality), non-random sampling of participants by many studies, and the use of different measurement tools and cut-off scores to measure mental health problems and other common risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that mental health problems are highly prevalent among FSWs in LMICs and are strongly associated with common risk factors. Study findings support the concept of overlapping vulnerabilities and highlight the urgent need for interventions designed to improve the mental health and well-being of FSWs.",,pubmed

Although conventional HIV surveillance systems capture individual-level behavioral risk, they are not able to capture the social and environmental factors contributing to rapid transmission. METHODS: HIV surveillance data were used to assess demographic, clinical, and behavioral factors for PWID with HIV diagnosed during 2017 and 2018. Social factors such as homelessness, disruption of encampments, and trends in sexual behaviors, drug use and syringe availability among PWID were captured through National HIV Behavioral Surveillance, routine hepatitis and sexually transmitted infection surveillance, and shelter and homeless outreach data. RESULTS: In 2018, there were 71 new infections among PWID, an increase of 115% since 2016. During this time, opioid overdose deaths peaked at 59 deaths per 100 000 persons, 85% of which involved the use of fentanyl. While overall reported homelessness increased, rates of those living unsheltered rose by 13%. The Philadelphia Department of Public Health identified increased injection frequency, encampment closures, and lack of syringe access as promoters of continued HIV transmission. CONCLUSION: The use of conventional surveillance methods only is inadequate for determining HIV risk during outbreaks. Incorporation of individual and aggregate level data on social and environmental determinants is necessary to develop effective outbreak response interventions.",,pubmed

We examined county-level vulnerability for this syndemic in South Dakota. METHODS: Informed by prior methodology from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we used acute and chronic HCV infections among persons aged </=40 years as a proxy measure of IDU. Twenty-nine county-level indicators potentially associated with HCV infection rates were identified. Using these indicators, we examined relationships through bivariate and multivariate analysis and calculated a composite index score to identify the most vulnerable counties (top 20%) to this syndemic. RESULTS: Of the most vulnerable counties, 69% are reservation counties and 62% are rural. The county-level HCV infection rate is 4 times higher in minority counties than nonminority counties, and almost all significant indicators of opioid-related vulnerability in our analysis are structural and potentially modifiable through public health interventions and policies. CONCLUSIONS: Our assessment gives context to the magnitude of this syndemic in rural reservation and frontier counties and should inform the strategic allocation of prevention and intervention services.",,pubmed

We assessed future HIV serological outcomes for individuals with indeterminate results and associated factors in Rakai, Uganda. METHODS: 115,944 serological results, defined by two enzyme immunoassay (EIAs), among 39,440 individuals aged 15-49 years in the Rakai Community Cohort Study were assessed. Indeterminate results were defined as contradictory EIAs. Modified Poisson regression models with generalized estimating equations were used to assess prevalence ratios (PRs) of subsequent HIV serological outcomes and factors associated with HIV indeterminate results. RESULTS: The prevalence of HIV serologically indeterminate results was 4.9%. Indeterminate results were less likely among women than men (adjPR 0.76, 95% CI 0.71,0.81), in unmarried participants than married participants (adjPR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85,99), and in individuals with primary (adjPR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80,1.02), secondary (adjPR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73,0.96) and post-secondary (adjPR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60,0.94) education, relative to no education. The proportions of persons with indeterminate results progressing to HIV positive, negative or indeterminate results in subsequent visits was 5%, 71% and 24%, respectively. CONCLUSION: HIV serologically indeterminate results were associated with gender and marital status. HIV surveillance programs should develop a protocol for reporting individuals with mixed or persistently indeterminate HIV results on multiple follow-up visits. Most indeterminate results became HIV-negative over time, but follow-up is still needed to detect positive serologies.",,pubmed

Understanding the disease ecology and environmental factors that influence its distribution is important to guide control efforts. Geographic information systems have increasingly been used in the field of schistosomiasis environmental epidemiology. This study reports prevalences of Schistosoma haematobium infection and uses remotely sensed and questionnaire data from over 17000 participants to identify environmental and socio-demographic factors that are associated with this parasitic infection. Data regarding socio-demographic status and S. haematobium infection were obtained between May 2006 and May 2007 from 17280 participants (53% females, median age = 17 years) in the Mbeya Region, Tanzania. Combined with remotely sensed environmental data (vegetation cover, altitude, rainfall etc.) this data was analyzed to identify environmental and socio-demographic factors associated with S. haematobium infection, using mixed effects logistic regression and geostatistical modelling. The overall prevalence of S. haematobium infection was 5.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 5.0-5.6%). Multivariable analysis revealed increased odds of infection for school-aged children (5-15 years, odds ratio (OR) = 7.8, CI: 5.9-10.4) and the age groups 15-25 and 25-35 years (15-25 years: OR = 5.8, CI: 4.3-8.0, 25-35 years: OR = 1.6, CI: 1.1-2.4) compared to persons above 35 years of age, for increasing distance to water courses (OR = 1.4, CI: 1.2-1.6 per km) and for proximity to Lake Nyasa (<1 km, OR = 4.5, CI: 1.8-11.4; 1-2 km, OR = 3.5, CI: 1.7-7.5; 2-4 km; OR = 3.3, CI: 1.7-6.6), when compared to distances >4 km. Odds of infection decreased with higher altitude (OR = 0.7, CI: 0.6-0.8 per 100 m increase) and with increasing enhanced vegetation index EVI (OR = 0.2, CI: 0.1-0.4 per 0.1 units). When additionally adjusting for spatial correlation population density became a significant predictor of schistosomiasis infection (OR = 1.3, CI: 1.1-1.5 per 1000 persons/km2) and altitude turned non-significant. We found highly focal geographical patterns of S. haematobium infection in Mbeya Region in Southwestern Tanzania. Despite low overall prevalence our spatially heterogeneous results show that some of the study sites suffer from a considerable burden of S. haematobium infection, which is related to various socio-demographic and environmental factors. Our results could help to design more effective control strategies in the future, especially targeting school-aged children living in low altitude sites and/or crowded areas as the persons at highest need for preventive chemotherapy.",,pubmed

Microbiological confirmation was achieved in 51 (68.92%) (48 PTB and 3 EPTB) cases while 23 (31.08%) were clinically diagnosed. Bilateral extensive fibro-cavitary disease with infiltrations was the commonest. Drug resistance was confirmed in 21 (28.38%) with 2, 5, 8, 5 and 1 patient diagnosed with mono H, RR, MDR, pre-XDR and XDR respectively but results of 9 patients were received posthumously. Treatment given was category 1, category 2 and regimens for drug resistant TB in 24 (32.43%), 29 (39.19%) and 21 (28.37%) cases respectively based on prior history of ATT and drug sensitivity. Adverse drug reactions were noted in 12 (16.21%) cases. Noted immediate causes of mortality were cardio-respiratory failure, sudden pneumothorax, massive hemoptysis, sepsis, extensive pulmonary disease and aspiration pneumonia. The pointers towards mortality include female gender, severe malnutrition, anemia, extensive disseminated disease and drug resistant TB. Ignorance, dependency of children on parents, poor adherence and late referrals into the system lead to delayed diagnosis and initiation of proper regimen based treatment. CONCLUSION: Early referrals of non-responders and failures to centers equipped with programmatic management facilities are essential for proper, timely management of pediatric TB to reduce mortality.",,pubmed
A389,Investigating the risk factors for contraction and diagnosis of human tuberculosis in Indonesia using data from the fifth wave of RAND's Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS-5).,10.1017/S0021932020000395,Adam N; Pallikadavath S; Cerasuolo M; Amos M,2021.0,Journal of biosocial science,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a globally widespread disease, with approximately a quarter of the world's population currently infected (WHO, 2018). Some risk factors, such as HIV status, nutrition and body mass index, have already been thoroughly investigated. However, little attention has been given to behavioural and/or psychological risk factors such as stress and education level. This study investigated the risk factors for TB diagnosis by statistical analyses of publicly available data from the most recent wave of the Indonesian Family Life survey (IFLS-5) conducted in 2015. Out of 34,249 respondents there were 328 who reported having TB. For comparison and completeness, variables were divided into levels: individual-, household- and community-level variables. The most prominent and interesting variables found to influence TB diagnosis status (on each level) were investigated, and a logistic regression was subsequently developed to understand the extent to which each risk factor acts as a predictor for being diagnosed with TB. Age, health benefit or insurance, stress at work and living in a rural area all showed significant association with TB diagnosis status. This study's findings suggest that suitable control measures, such as schemes for improving mental health/stress reduction and improved access to health care in rural areas should be implemented in Indonesia to address each of the key factors identified.",,pubmed

This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors for HIV infection among young Thai men. METHODS: A total survey was conducted of Royal Thai Army new conscripts, participating in the national HIV surveillance in November 2010 and May 2011. Behavioral risk factors for HIV infection were determined using a standardized survey questionnaire in the total study population and men who have sex with men (MSM) subgroup. RESULTS: A total of 301 (0.5%) HIV infected young Thai men were identified from the total study population (63,667). Independent risk factors associated with HIV infection among the total study population included being single (adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 1.6, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.1-2.2), having no formal education (AOR 6.5, 95% CI 2.3-18.4) or a bachelor's degree (AOR 1. 8, 95% CI 1.0-3.0), engaging in bisexual (AOR 3.7, 95% CI 2.4-5. 6) or exclusively homosexual activity (AOR 14.4, 95% CI 10.4-19.8), having a history of Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) (AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.6-3.3) and having sex in exchange for gifts/money (AOR 2.0, 95% CI 1. 5-2.8). A total of 4,594 (7.9%) MSM were identified, of which 121 (2.6%) were HIV infected. The prevalence of HIV infection among MSM in urban (2.8%) and rural (2.4%) areas were relatively comparable (p-value = 0.44). Of the identified MSM, 82.5% reported having sexual desire with females only. Risk factors associated with HIV infection in the MSM subgroup included living in the western region (AOR 3.5, 95% CI 1.2-10.4), having a bachelor's degree (AOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-5.7), having a history of exclusive receptive (AOR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-7.7) or versatile anal sex (AOR 4.7, 95% CI 3.0-7.5) and history of having sex in exchange for gifts/money (AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.5-3.5). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HIV infection among young Thai men has continued to be below 0.5% in 2010 and 2011. High risk sexual activity, including MSM, played a major role in the HIV epidemic among this population. Effective HIV prevention programs should cover MSM who have heterosexual desire as well as having sex in exchange for gifts/money and be implemented in both urban and rural areas.",,pubmed
A391,County-level factors affecting Latino HIV disparities in the United States.,10.1371/journal.pone.0237269,Benbow ND; Aaby DA; Rosenberg ES; Brown CH,2020.0,PloS one,"OBJECTIVE: To determine which county-level social, economic, demographic, epidemiologic and access to care factors are associated with Latino/non-Latino White disparities in prevalence of diagnosed HIV infection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used 2016 county-level prevalence rates of diagnosed HIV infection rates for Latinos and non-Latino Whites obtained from the National HIV Surveillance System and factors obtained from multiple publicly available datasets. We used mixed effects Poisson modeling of observed HIV prevalence at the county-level to identify county-level factors that explained homogeneous effects across race/ethnicity and differential effects for Latinos and NL-Whites. Overall, the median Latinos disparity in HIV prevalence is 2.4; 94% of the counties have higher rates for Latinos than non-Latinos, and one-quarter of the counties' disparities exceeded 10. Of the 41 county-level factors examined, 24 showed significant effect modification when examined individually. In multi-variable modeling, 11 county-level factors were found that significantly affected disparities. Factors that increased disparity with higher, compared to lower values included proportion of HIV diagnoses due to injection drug use, percent Latino living in poverty, percent not English proficient, and percent Puerto Rican. Latino disparities increased with decreasing percent severe housing, drug overdose mortality rate, percent rural, female prevalence rate, social association rate, percent change in Latino population, and Latino to NL-White proportion of the population. These factors while significant had minimal effects on diminishing disparity, but did substantially reduce the variance in disparity rates. CONCLUSIONS: Large differences in HIV prevalence rates persist across almost all counties even after controlling for county-level factors. Counties that are more rural, have fewer Latinos, or have lower NL-White prevalence rates tend to have higher disparities. There is also higher disparity when community risk is low.",,pubmed

To determine the prevalence of HIV and TB among individuals found at bars in slums of Kampala, Uganda, we enrolled adults found at bars that provided written informed consent. Individuals with alcohol intoxication were excluded. We performed HIV testing using immunochromatographic antibody tests (Alere Determine HIV-1/2 and Chembio HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK). TB was confirmed using the Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assay, performed on single spot sputum samples. We enrolled 272 participants from 42 bars in 5 slums. The prevalence of HIV and TB was 11.4% (95% CI 8.1-15.8) and 15 (95% CI 6-39) per 1,000 population respectively. Predictors of HIV were female sex (aOR 5.87, 95% CI 2.05-16.83), current cigarette smoking (aOR 3.23, 95% CI 1.02-10.26), history of TB treatment (aOR 10.19, 95% CI 3.17-32.82) and CAGE scores of 2-3 (aOR 3.90, 95% CI 1.11-13.70) and 4 (aOR 4.77, 95% CI 1.07-21.35). The prevalence of HIV and TB was twice and four times the national averages respectively. These findings highlight the need for concurrent programmatic screening for both HIV and TB among high risk populations in slums.",,pubmed

The disease is a serious public health problem, and is directly linked to social issues. We analyzed temporal trend variations in areas at risk for concomitant TB, and characterized the clinical and epidemiological profiles of cases in a hyperendemic municipality in the Amazon region of Brazil. METHODS: This ecological study was performed in the municipality of Manaus, in northern Brazil. The population comprised cases with concomitant pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB, registered on the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN), between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2018. For risk cluster detection, spatial and spatiotemporal scanning statistical techniques were used. The Spatial Variation in Temporal Trends (SVTT) approach was used to detect and infer clusters for significantly different time trends. RESULTS: Between 2009 and 2018, 873 concomitant TB cases were registered in Manaus. By using purely spatial scanning statistics, we identified two risk clusters. The relative risk (RR) of the clusters was 2.21 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.57-2.88; P = 0.0031) and 2.03 (95% CI: 1.58-2.58; P = 0.0029). Using space-time scanning, we identified a risk cluster with an RR of 3.57 (95% CI: 2.84-4.41; P = 0.014), between 2017 and 2018. For SVTT analyses, three clusters with spatial variations were detected in the significant temporal trends: SVTT 1 (P = 0.042), SVTT 2 (P = 0.046) and SVTT 3 (P = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: In Brazil, several TB-determining factors such as race/color, gender, low educational level and low income overlap in needy urban areas and communities, demonstrating that it is unlikely to reach the goals, agreed and launched with the END TB Strategy within the deadlines of international agreements, if there is no reduction in existing inequities determinants and risk of illness in the country.",,pubmed

This study was planned with the aim of assessing the anxiety levels of PLHIV and the sources of their anxiety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was sent to PLHIV using the virtual snowball sampling method. The questionnaire included questions about sociodemographic status, information about HIV infection, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Additionally, some opinions of the participants about COVID-19 were asked. RESULTS: A total of 307 respondents, with a median age of 33 years, from 32 different cities, participated in the study. More than half of the respondents reported the belief that COVID-19 was not sufficiently well-known by the medical community and nearly 45% believed that they would have more complications if they contracted COVID-19. One-fourth of the participants had anxiety. Having a preexisting psychiatric disorder, perceiving that they were practicing insufficient preventive measures, not being sure about the presence of any individuals with COVID-19 in their environment, and living with a household member with a chronic disease were found to be the risk factors of PLHIV for having anxiety during this pandemic. The BAI scores were correlated with the patient-reported anxiety levels about the spread of COVID-19 in Turkey, acquiring COVID-19, transmitting COVID-19 to another person, and transmitting HIV to another person. Among the stated conditions, the most common concern was the spread of COVID-19 all over the country, while the least common was transmitting HIV to someone else. CONCLUSION: The results revealed that a significant proportion of the sample had anxiety, and the findings were essential for developing evidence-based strategies for decreasing the anxiety of PLHIV, especially for those who had risk factors and to provide them with better health care during this pandemic or other pandemic-like crises.",,pubmed

Few studies examine common predictors across these outcomes. This observational venue-based sample of 546 MSM in Shanghai, China used a common set of psychosocial predictors to construct logistic models for the outcomes (HIV non-testing, syphilis non-testing, HIV sero-status, and syphilis sero-status). Fifty-seven (10.7%) participants tested positive for HIV, 126 (23.5%) for syphilis, and 33% of HIV-positive participants had a co-infection. Non-sex working MSM had consistently higher odds of HIV and syphilis non-testing (OR= 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.5, p < 0.001; OR = 2.4, 95, 95% CI 1.5-3.8, p < 0.001, respectively) compared to 'money boy' sex workers. Participants with a 0 score on HIV knowledge had 4.1 times (95% CI 1.4-12.5, p = 0.01) the odds of reporting HIV non-testing, 6.0 (95% CI 1.96-18.5, p < 0.01) times the odds of reporting non-testing for syphilis, and 8.44 times (95% CI 1.19-59.7, p = 0.03) the odds of testing positive for HIV, compared to a score of 8. The results highlighted the importance of integrating HIV/syphilis education and promoting testing for both HIV and syphilis among all sub-groups of MSM in China.",,pubmed

It also has high mortality and low cure rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive TB patients. This study aimed to analyse, under the integrated TB control model, the characteristics of TB patients seeking healthcare in the largest designated TB hospital in Chongqing. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of TB registers in a health facility. Record data of 1827 TB patients who had attended the Chongqing Public Health Medical Center (CPHMC) from 1 January to 31 December 2018 were included. The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS 18.0; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to analyse the data. Counting data were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher' s exact test. Among the results of the univariate analysis, the variables with statistical significance were included in the binomial stepwise logistic regression, with odds ratio and 95% confidence interval calculated. A two-tailed probability level of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The majority of registered patients were men (1197), of Han ethnicity (1670), aged 21-60 years (1331), farmer/unemployed (1075), and living in county/district (1207). Approximately 24.9% of patients (455/1827) contracted DR-TB, 6% (110/1827) were co-infected with HIV, and 41.0% (749/1827) had drug-related hepatotoxicity. Among those patients, DR-TB was more likely to develop among farmers who received retreatment and had drug-related hepatotoxicity (P < 0.05). Women who received retreatment and lived in county/district were less likely to be HIV positive (P < 0.05). Compared with farmers, patients who were unemployed were more likely to be HIV positive, and those aged 21-60 years had a higher risk of being tested as HIV positive (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Farmers who received retreatment and had drug-related hepatotoxicity are more susceptible to DR-TB; young unemployed men have a higher risk of contracting HIV-positive TB. The demographic and clinical characteristics of TB patients should be taken into consideration in DR-TB and HIV-positive TB screening in the future.",,pubmed

Method: In 2013, a survey on low-tier FSWs was carried out in 21 Demonstration Areas of AIDS Responses in Zhejiang. Experience of having anal sex with clients in the last month was taken as dependent variable while independent variables would include perception and characteristics related to behavior of the FSWs. The multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the factors related to anal sex in low-tier FSWs. Results: A total of 2 645 low-tier FSWs were interviewed. Among these FSWs, 67.9% (1 796/2 645) were over 26 years old, 89.9% (2 378/2 645) were with education level of junior high school or below, 58.4% (1 546/2 645) were married, 78.2% (2 068/2 645) were from other provinces, 68.6% (1 814/2 645) had income level less than 4 000 Yuan, and rates of anal sex with client in the last month were 5.03% (133/2 645). Results from the multivariate logistic regression analysis of related factors of anal sex with client in the last month showed that among the low-tier FSWs, the venues of having commercial sex were in hair salons/massage parlors (OR=7.31, 95%CI: 2.27-23.59), roadside shops (OR=7.89, 95%CI: 2.27- 27.40) or other places (OR=4.65, 95%CI: 1.23-17.53), when compared with the street-women service. FSWs often engaged in commercial sex business in three or more counties (OR=1.68, 95%CI: 1.01-2.81), when compared with FSWs often engaged in commercial sex business just one county. FSWs had sex with only middle-aged and the elderly clients (OR=0.45, 95%CI: 0.30-0.66), when compared with FSWs had sex with young or middle-aged and the elderly clients. FSWs had risk perception for sexually transmitted disease (STD) (OR=2.00, 95%CI: 1.20-3.32), when compared with FSWs with no risk perception. FSWs had oral sex experience with their clients in the last month (OR=7.29, 95%CI: 4.78-11.12), when compared with the ones without oral sex. The above said factors were all related to the incidence of anal sex. Conclusions: Certain numbers of low-tier FSWs had anal sex experiences with their clients, especially those who had oral sex were more likely to have anal sex in DACAR in Zhejiang province. Attention should be paid to anal sex behavior when conducting behavior-related intervention programs, targeting on the low-tier FSWs.",,pubmed

In a published survey around Rourkela in 2013-2014 (N = 1307), malaria prevalence was found to be 8.3%. Using these data, villages were divided into low (<2%), medium (2-10%) and high (>10%) malaria prevalence, and risk factors assessed by type of village. In the six low malaria villages, four persons were positive by PCR; in the four medium malaria villages, prevalence was 7% (35 infections, 7 P. vivax); and in the three high malaria villages, prevalence was 21% (62 infections, 10 P. vivax and 5 mixed with P. vivax and P. falciparum). A total of 30.6% infections were submicroscopic and 40.6% were asymptomatic. Our analyses showed that the rainy season and male gender were risk factors for malaria; in high malaria villages, young age was an additional risk factor, and indoor and outdoor spraying was protective compared to no spraying. We undertook a subsequent behavioral survey in four of the medium and high malaria villages in 2017 to investigate the behavioral aspects of malaria risk. Among 500 participants in 237 households, adult men (15+ years) were more likely to be outside in the evening (34.5% vs. 7.9% among adult women 15+ years and 0.7% among children, p < 0.001), or to sleep outside (7.5% vs. 0.5% and 0%, respectively, p < 0.001). Although women were more likely to get up before 6 a.m. (86.6%, vs. 70.5% among men, 50.7% among children, p < 0.001), men were more likely to be outside in the early morning (77.6% among men, 11.2% among women, and 11.1% among children, p < 0.001). More children used insecticide treated nets the previous night (73.4%) than men (45.6%) or women (39.6%), and repellents were used by 29.5% of 234 households (insecticide creams were not used at all).

This study aimed to explore the prevalence and risk factors related to severe P. knowlesi infection. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted by retrieving all published articles on severe P. knowlesi available in Web of Science (ISI), Scopus, and PubMed (MEDLINE). Titles, abstracts, and full-text articles were screened, and any irrelevant studies were excluded. The random-effects model was used to compute the pooled prevalence estimate of severe P. knowlesi infection by a metaprop command provided in STATA software. Differences in demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory data were analysed using Review Manager Version 5.3 software for patients in the following groups: 1) patients with severe and non-severe P. knowlesi infection and 2) patients with severe P. knowlesi and severe P. falciparum infection. RESULTS: Out of the 2382 studies retrieved from the three databases, seven studies with a total enrolment of 1124 patients with P. knowlesi infections were eligible to be included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence estimate of severe P. knowlesi infection was 19% (95% CI: 11-27%, I(2) = 93.7%). Severe acute kidney injuries (AKI) (77 cases, 45.6%), jaundice (71 cases, 42%), and hyperparasitaemia (55 cases, 32.5%) were the common clinical manifestations found among patients with severe complications. In comparison to non-severe P. knowlesi infections, patients with severe P. knowlesi infections had significantly higher age, leucocyte count, and parasitaemia levels (P < 0.05). In comparison to patients with severe P. falciparum infections, patients with severe P. knowlesi infections had significantly higher age, neutrophil count, and creatinine levels (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated a high proportion of severe P. knowlesi infections. Patients with severe P. knowlesi infections had higher age, leucocyte count, and parasitaemia levels than those with non-severe P. knowlesi infections. In addition, patients with severe P. knowlesi infections had higher age, neutrophil count, and creatinine levels than those with severe P. falciparum infections.",,pubmed

Black women's HIV diagnosis rates are 15 times higher than White women, and is among the leading causes of death among Black women in the US. Previous studies support the association between substance use and HIV risk, yet it is essential to better understand the specific factors experienced within the context of substance misuse and recovery among vulnerable Black women at-risk for substance misuse, HIV, and adverse life experiences. We conducted qualitative interviews with 31 black women (age M = 32.13, range 18-57) four times over six months. Eligible participants were 18+ years, identified as a Black/African-American woman, had unprotected vaginal or anal sex with a man in the past 30 days, and spoke fluent English. All transcripts were transcribed verbatim and were analyzed used thematic content analysis. Two groups of participants emerged: 1) those in recovery from their drug of choice (n = 11, 7 of whom misused alcohol or marijuana during the study), and 2) those who misused their drug of choice during the study (active use group; n = 20). Four themes emerged in the context of substance use: cultural factors, structural factors (i.e., housing and employment), past and present adverse life experiences, and individual factors (i.e., substance use to cope with stress, self-medicating with substances for mental health symptoms, intimate partner violence, and sex exchange). While participants in both groups used substances to cope with regard to these factors, the recovery group tended to use substances at lower frequencies and did not relapse with their drug of choice during the study. The active use group reported more substance use with regard to structural factors and recent adverse life events, had more difficulty regarding employment, and less instances of intimate partner violence (IPV) but were more likely to cope using substances. Substance use interventions tailored to vulnerable Black women should consider including trauma-informed interventions and support groups that address the structural, social, and individual factors to better serve their needs.",,pubmed
A402,Spatial analysis of factors associated with HIV infection in Malawi: indicators for effective prevention.,10.1186/s12889-020-09278-0,Nutor JJ; Duah HO; Agbadi P; Duodu PA; Gondwe KW,2020.0,BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to model the predictors of HIV prevalence in Malawi through a complex sample logistic regression and spatial mapping approach using the national Demographic and Health Survey datasets. METHODS: We conducted a secondary data analysis using the 2015-2016 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey and AIDS Indicator Survey. The analysis was performed in three stages while incorporating population survey sampling weights to: i) interpolate HIV data, ii) identify the spatial clusters with the high prevalence of HIV infection, and iii) perform a multivariate complex sample logistic regression. RESULTS: In all, 14,779 participants were included in the analysis with an overall HIV prevalence of 9% (7.0% in males and 10.8% in females). The highest prevalence was found in the southern region of Malawi (13.2%), and the spatial interpolation revealed that the HIV epidemic is worse at the south-eastern part of Malawi. The districts in the high HIV prevalent zone of Malawi are Thyolo, Zomba, Mulanje, Phalombe and Blantyre. In central and northern region, the district HIV prevalence map identified Lilongwe in the central region and Karonga in the northern region as districts that equally deserve attention. People residing in urban areas had a 2.2 times greater risk of being HIV-positive compared to their counterparts in the rural areas (AOR = 2.16; 95%CI = 1.57-2.97). Other independent predictors of HIV prevalence were gender, age, marital status, number of lifetime sexual partners, extramarital partners, the region of residence, condom use, history of STI in the last 12 months, and household wealth index. Disaggregated analysis showed in-depth sociodemographic regional variations in HIV prevalence. CONCLUSION: These findings identify high-risk populations and regions to be targeted for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) campaigns, HIV testing, treatment and education to decrease incidence, morbidity, and mortality related to HIV infection in Malawi.",,pubmed

The current study aimed to evaluate the climate change induced socio-economic vulnerability of local communities to dengue in Colombo and Kandy districts of Sri Lanka. METHODS: A total of 42 variables (entomological, epidemiological, meteorological parameters, land-use practices and socio-demographic data) of all the 38 Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas in the districts of Colombo and Kandy were considered as candidate variables for a composite index based vulnerability assessment. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used in selecting and setting the weight for each indicator. Exposure, Sensitivity, Adaptive Capacity and Vulnerability of all MOH areas for dengue were calculated using the composite index approach recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. RESULTS: Out of 42 candidate variables, only 23 parameters (Exposure Index: six variables; Sensitivity Index: 11 variables; Adaptive Capacity Index: six variables) were selected as indicators to assess climate change vulnerability to dengue. Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) MOH area denoted the highest values for exposure (0.89: exceptionally high exposure), sensitivity (0.86: exceptionally high sensitivity) in Colombo, while Kandy Municipal Council (KMC) area reported the highest exposure (0.79: high exposure) and sensitivity (0.77: high sensitivity) in Kandy. Piliyandala MOH area denoted the highest level of adaptive capacity (0.66) in Colombo followed by Menikhinna (0.68) in Kandy. The highest vulnerability (0.45: moderate vulnerability) to dengue was indicated from CMC and the lowest indicated from Galaha MOH (0.15; very low vulnerability) in Kandy. Interestingly the KMC MOH area had a notable vulnerability of 0.41 (moderate vulnerability), which was the highest within Kandy. CONCLUSIONS: In general, vulnerability for dengue was relatively higher within the MOH areas of Colombo, than in Kandy, suggesting a higher degree of potential susceptibility to dengue within and among local communities of Colombo. Vector Controlling Entities are recommended to consider the spatial variations in vulnerability of local communities to dengue for decision making, especially in allocation of limited financial, human and mechanical resources for dengue epidemic management.",,pubmed

Evidence of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) after initiation of the Universal Test and Treat (UTT) strategy was limited in Ethiopia. So, this study aimed to determine the proportion of ART adherence after the initiation of UTT strategy and associated factors among adult PLHIV in Dessie town using two adherence measurements. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 293 PLHIV selected using a systematic sampling technique. The data were collected by face-to face-interview using a pretested questionnaire; chart review was also used to collect the data. The proportion of ART adherence measured by using the Morisky scale and seven-day recall was 49.3% (95% CI: [43.5%, 54.8%]) and 95.9% (95% CI: [93.2%, 98.2%]), respectively. Being urban in residence (AOR = 3.72, 95% CI: [1.80, 7.68]), the absence of depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.72, 95% CI: [1.22, 11.35]), taking one tablet per day (AOR = 3.26, 95% CI: [1.64, 6.49]), and the absence of concomitant illness (AOR = 0.23, 95% CI: [0.09, 0.59]) were factors associated with ART adherence. The proportion of ART adherence measured by the Morisky scale was very low; however, adherence measured by seven-day recall was higher and consistent with World Health Organization recommendations. Residence, depression, and the number of tablets taken per day had a positive association with good ART adherence whereas having concomitant illness had a negative association with good ART adherence. Efforts should be made to improve adherence and interventions should be given to overcome factors linked with poor adherence.",,pubmed

This study examined patterns and predictors of suicidal ideation among women living with HIV in antenatal care in Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. DESIGN: We conducted a longitudinal cohort study of 200 pregnant women living with HIV, with surveys conducted during pregnancy and 6 months postpartum. METHODS: Pregnant women were recruited during HIV and antenatal care visits at nine clinics. A structured questionnaire was verbally administered in Kiswahili by a trained study nurse. We used simple frequencies and t-tests to measure patterns of suicidal ideation and logistic regression to assess factors associated with suicidal ideation. RESULTS: Suicidal ideation was endorsed by 12.8% of women during pregnancy and decreased significantly to 3.9% by 6 months postpartum. Ideation was not significantly greater among participants newly diagnosed with HIV. In univariable analyses, suicidal ideation was associated with depression, anxiety, HIV stigma, single relationship status, unknown HIV status of the father of the baby, negative attitudes about antiretroviral medication, and low social support. In the multivariable model, women experiencing anxiety and HIV stigma were significantly more likely to endorse suicidal ideation during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Suicidal ideation and associated feelings of hopelessness are a critical challenge in antenatal care among women living with HIV, with important implications for quality of life, care engagement, and survival. To better support patients, targeted approaches to address anxiety, depression, stigma, and hopelessness must be prioritized, including crisis support for suicide prevention.",,pubmed
A406,Challenges posed by COVID-19 to people who inject drugs and lessons from other outbreaks.,10.1002/jia2.25583,Vasylyeva TI; Smyrnov P; Strathdee S; Friedman SR,2020.0,Journal of the International AIDS Society,"INTRODUCTION: In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, considerable effort is going into identifying and protecting those at risk. Criminalization, stigmatization and the psychological, physical, behavioural and economic consequences of substance use make people who inject drugs (PWID) extremely vulnerable to many infectious diseases. While relationships between drug use and blood-borne and sexually transmitted infections are well studied, less attention has been paid to other infectious disease outbreaks among PWID. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 is likely to disproportionally affect PWID due to a high prevalence of comorbidities that make the disease more severe, unsanitary and overcrowded living conditions, stigmatization, common incarceration, homelessness and difficulties in adhering to quarantine, social distancing or self-isolation mandates. The COVID-19 pandemic also jeopardizes essential for PWID services, such as needle exchange or substitution therapy programmes, which can be affected both in a short- and a long-term perspective. Importantly, there is substantial evidence of other infectious disease outbreaks in PWID that were associated with factors that enable COVID-19 transmission, such as poor hygiene, overcrowded living conditions and communal ways of using drugs. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 crisis might increase risks of homelessnes, overdoses and unsafe injecting and sexual practices for PWID. In order to address existing inequalities, consultations with PWID advocacy groups are vital when designing inclusive health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",,pubmed

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2017 to January 2018 among 326 HIV-positive women. Cervical smears were collected for examination at the AIDS Preventive Initiative of Nigeria clinics of Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH) and Bingham University Teaching Hospital (BhUTH), Jos, Nigeria. Demographic characteristics of participants were documented using a structured questionnaire. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 21. RESULTS: Of the 326 participants, precancerous cervical lesions were present in 40 (12.2%) women: 4 (1.2%) had atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, 19 (5.8%) had low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 1 (0.3%) had atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 13 (4.0%) had high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and 3 (0.9%) had high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, suspected for invasion. The multivariate logistics regression model showed that parity (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.3-9.5, P=0.043) was a significant predictor of precancerous cervical lesions. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of precancerous cervical lesions among HIV-infected women is relatively low compared to earlier reported prevalence in an HIV population in Jos. Increasing parity was a significant predictor.",,pubmed

Its consequences include low birth weight and maternal mortality. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of anaemia and to identify its determinants in Sudanese women in reproductive age. METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Sudan in 2016. A multi-stage stratified cluster sampling design was executed with consideration of rural population, urban population, and internally displaced persons/refugees camps residents. All women in reproductive age (15-49 years), classified by pregnancy status, in the targeted households were surveyed and personal characteristic data were collected. Their haemoglobin level and malaria infection (using rapid diagnostic test, RDT) were assessed. The World Health Organization (WHO) haemoglobin level cut-off for defining anaemia and severe anaemia in pregnant and non-pregnant women was used. Logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 4271 women (WRA) of which 421 (9.9%) pregnant women (PW) were included in the study. The overall anaemia prevalence in WRA was 35.6%. It was 36.0 and 35.5% in PW and non-pregnant women (NPW), respectively. The average haemoglobin level was found to be 113.9 g/L (SD 16.3) and 123.2 g/L (SD 15.7) for PW and NPW respectively. Severe anaemia prevalence was 1.2% in each group. In the logistic regression model, anaemia was associated with malaria infection in PW (aOR 4.100, 95%CI 1.523-11.039, p = 0.003), NPW (aOR 2.776, 95%CI 1.889-4.080, p < 0.001), and WRA (aOR 2.885, 95%CI 2.021-4.119, p < 0.001). Other identified determinants of anaemia in NPW was living in camps (aOR 1.499, 95%CI 1.115-2.017, p = 0.007) and in WRA was being in the poorest economic class (aOR 1.436, 95%CI 1.065-1.936, p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Anaemia is a public health problem in Sudan. The study supported the association between malaria infection and anaemia, but not with low and moderate malaria transmission areas. Resources need to be allocated for all anaemic populations with special attention for the populations in most need and interventions need to be implemented based on local variations. Malaria control interventions, specifically case management, may have a major impact in reducing anaemia prevalence in low to moderate malaria transmission areas.",,pubmed

The direct effects of COVID are less of a concern in children, who seem to be largely asymptomatic or to develop mild illness as occurs in high income countries; however children in LMICs constitute a high proportion of the population and may have a high prevalence of risk factors for severe lower respiratory infection such as HIV or malnutrition. Further diversion of resources from child health to address the pandemic among adults may further impact on care for children. Poor living conditions in LMICs including lack of sanitation, running water and overcrowding may facilitate transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The indirect effects of the pandemic on child health are of considerable concern, including increasing poverty levels, disrupted schooling, lack of access to school feeding schemes, reduced access to health facilities and interruptions in vaccination and other child health programs. Further challenges in LMICs include the inability to implement effective public health measures such as social distancing, hand hygiene, timely identification of infected people with self-isolation and universal use of masks. Lack of adequate personal protective equipment, especially N95 masks is a key concern for health care worker protection. While continued schooling is crucial for children in LMICs, provision of safe environments is especially challenging in overcrowded resource constrained schools. The current crisis is a harsh reminder of the global inequity in health in LMICs. The pandemic highlights key challenges to the provision of health in LMICs, but also provides opportunities to strengthen child health broadly in such settings.",,pubmed
A410,Transitions in adolescent boys and young Men's high-risk sexual behaviour in India.,10.1186/s12889-020-09191-6,Sharma SK; Vishwakarma D,2020.0,BMC public health,"BACKGROUND: The sexual behaviour of adolescents is of importance due to the engagement in risky sexual activity at a too early age, which may be associated with the adverse outcomes. The study aims to understand the transitions in adolescent boys and young men's high-risk sexual behaviour in India using two rounds of Indian demographic health survey, NFHS-3 (2005-06) and NFHS-4 (2015-16). METHODS: A total of 25,538 in NFHS-3 (2005-06) and 35,112 in NFHS-4 (2015-16) men were considered for the analysis. Men have been divided into two age groups as 15-19 years (adolescent) and 20-24 (young men) for comparison purposes. Descriptive and multivariate statistics have been used. RESULTS: Overall, high-risk sexual behaviour has increased among adolescent boys (64 to 70%) and young men (18 to 27%) from 2005-06 to 2015-16. The trend of live-in relationship has increased among adolescent boys of rural areas (0.6 to 6.0%) as well as in urban areas (3.1 to 10.9%) over the last 10 years. Adolescent boys having 10th and above years of schooling (AOR = 1.98; p < 0.01), residing in urban areas (AOR = 2.23; p < 0.01), and belonging to the affluent class of households (AOR = 1.41; p < 0.05) were more likely to engage in high-risk sexual activity than the young men in India. The odds of high-risk sexual behaviour was higher among alcohol-using adolescent boys (AOR = 1.82; p < 0.01) and young men (AOR = 2.38; p < 0.01) in 2015-16. CONCLUSIONS: The study concludes that early sexual debut, lower prevalence of condom use at first sexual experience, tendency of live-in-relationship, and alcohol consumption indicate the hazardous interconnection between such behaviours among adolescent boys over the last decade which placed them at higher-risky sexual behaviour as compared to young men. Adolescent' sexual behaviours have both short-term and long-term consequences, and interventions that focus on multiple domains of risk may be the most effective in helping to promote broad reproductive health among young adults.",,pubmed

Outpatient data from five health facilities in western Kenya, comprising 19,458 adults >/= 15 years tested for HIV from September 2017 to May 2018, were included in univariable and multivariable analyses used for algorithm development. Data for 11,330 adults attending one high-volume facility were used for validation. Using the final algorithm, patients were grouped into four risk-score categories: </= 9, 10-15, 16-29 and >/= 30, with increasing HIV prevalence of 0.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46-0.75], 1.35% (95% CI 0.85-1.84), 2.65% (95% CI 1.8-3.51), and 15.15% (95% CI 9.03-21.27), respectively. The algorithm's discrimination performance was modest, with an area under the receiver-operating-curve of 0.69 (95% CI 0.53-0.84). In settings where universal testing is not feasible, a risk-score algorithm can identify sub-populations with higher HIV-risk to be prioritized for HIV testing.",,pubmed

A retrospective cohort study was conducted during the period 2009-2015 to investigate the syphilis seroprevalence and incidence of syphilis seroconversion among newly-diagnosed PLHIV in rural Yunnan, China. Recent HIV infection among PLHIV was identified by BED capture enzyme immunoassay. PLHIV were followed until they initiated antiretroviral therapy. Syphilis serology was conducted at baseline and each follow-up over the study period. Among 2162 participants, the syphilis seroprevalence at baseline was 2.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) (2.4-3.1). Single and divorced (versus married) (aOR = 2.9, [1.1-7.4]; 5.9, [2.4-14.7], respectively), employed in the service industry (versus unemployed) (2.8, [1.4-5.6]), being diagnosed with HIV in hospitals (versus voluntary counselling and testing) (5.1, [2.0-12.9]), recent HIV infection (17.9, [8.5-37.9]) and inconsistent condom use in the previous three months (versus consistent condom use) (6.2, [2.8-13.4]) were associated with higher risk of syphilis infection at baseline. Participants contributed 1955.4 person-years (PYs) of follow-up, with a median follow-up period of 0.9 years (IQR: 0.5-1.9) and the incidence of syphilis seroconversion was 2.2 (95% CI 1.5-2.9) per 100 PYs.

We determined how these conditions evolved, what factors influenced their evolution, and their clinical impact. METHODS: Ambulatory, community-dwelling HIV seropositive individuals were recruited at six research centers. Clinical evaluations at baseline and 12 years later determined neuropathy signs and distal neuropathic pain (DNP). Additional assessments measured activities of daily living and quality of life (QOL). Factors potentially associated with DSP and DNP progression included disease severity, treatment, demographics, and co-morbidities. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated for follow-up neuropathy outcomes. RESULTS: Of 254 participants, 21.3% were women, 57.5% were non-white. Mean baseline age was 43.5 years. Polyneuropathy prevalence increased from 25.7% to 43.7%. Of 173 participants initially pain-free, 42 (24.3%) had incident neuropathic pain. Baseline risk factors for incident pain included unemployment (OR [95% CI], 5.86 [1.97, 17.4]) and higher baseline body mass index (BMI) (1.78 [1.03, 3.19] per 10-units). Participants with neuropathic pain at follow-up had significantly worse QOL and greater dependence in activities of daily living than those who remained pain-free. INTERPRETATION: HIV DSP and neuropathic pain increased in prevalence and severity over 12 years despite high rates of viral suppression. The high burden of neuropathy included disability and poor life quality. However, substantial numbers remained pain-free despite clear evidence of neuropathy on exam. Protective factors included being employed and having a lower BMI. Implications for clinical practice include promotion of lifestyle changes affecting reversible risk factors.",,pubmed

DESIGN: Prospectively cohort study of children with cerebral malaria, severe malarial anemia, or community children. SETTING: Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. SUBJECTS: Children 18 months to 12 years old with severe malaria (cerebral malaria, n = 253 or severe malarial anemia, n = 211) or community children (n = 206) were followed for 24 months. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Children underwent neurocognitive evaluation at enrollment (community children) or a week following hospital discharge (severe malaria) and 6, 12, and 24 months follow-up. Endothelial activation was assessed at admission on plasma samples (von Willebrand factor, angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, soluble E-Selectin, and P-Selectin). False discovery rate was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Severe malaria was associated with widespread endothelial activation compared with community children (p < 0.0001 for all markers). Acute kidney injury was independently associated with changes in von Willebrand factor, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble E-Selectin, P-Selectin, and angiopoietin-2 (p < 0.0001 for all). A log10 increase in angiopoietin-2 was associated with lower cognitive z scores across age groups (children < 5, beta -0.42, 95% CI, -0.69 to -0.15, p = 0.002; children >/= 5, beta -0.39, 95% CI, -0.67 to -0.11, p = 0.007) independent of disease severity (coma, number of seizures, acute kidney injury) and sociodemographic factors. Angiopoietin-2 was associated with hemolysis (lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin) and inflammation (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-10). In children with cerebral malaria who had a lumbar puncture performed, angiopoietin-2 was associated with blood-brain barrier dysfunction, and markers of neuroinflammation and injury in the cerebrospinal fluid (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, kynurenic acid, tau). CONCLUSIONS: These data support angiopoietin-2 as a measure of disease severity and a risk factor for long-term cognitive injury in children with severe malaria.",,pubmed

Those with a history of alcohol intake had a higher HIV prevalence than those without (AOR = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.3-5.3). CONCLUSION: HIV prevalence was lower than it was in 2011. Age, level of education, and history of alcohol intake were strong predictors for HIV infection calling for targeted behavioral change interventions.",,pubmed

To examine the relative contributions of types of human mobility on malaria prevalence, this analysis quantifies the proportion of the population having recently traveled during both peak and nonpeak transmission seasons over the course of 2 years and assesses the relationship between short-term travel and malaria infection status. Among all residents targeted by mass drug administration in the Lake Kariba region of Southern Province, 602,620 rapid diagnostic tests and recent travel histories were collected during four campaign rounds occurring between December 2014 and February 2016. Rates of short-term travel in the previous 2 weeks fluctuated seasonally from 0.3% to 1.2%. Travel was significantly associated with prevalent malaria infection both seasonally and overall (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.55; 95% CI: 2.28-2.85). The strength of association between travel and malaria infection varied by travelers' origin and destination, with those recently traveling to high-prevalence areas from low-prevalence areas experiencing the highest odds of malaria infection (AOR: 7.38). Long-lasting insecticidal net usage while traveling was associated with a relative reduction in infections (AOR: 0.74) compared with travelers not using a net. Although travel was directly associated with only a small fraction of infections, importation of malaria via human movement may play an increasingly important role in this elimination setting as transmission rates continue to decline.",,pubmed

However, there is limited data on the patient-centered approach to HHCT. Our study aimed to describe experiences and preferences of household contacts (HHCs) for HHCT. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study in Rustenburg, South Africa from September 2013 to March 2015. Twenty-four HHCs (>/=18 years) had audio-recorded in-depth interviews. We used an inductive thematic analysis approach to develop themes. We made an a priori assumption that we would reach saturation with at least 20 interviews. RESULTS: There were 16 (66.7%) females (median age = 36 years) and eight (33.3%) males (median age = 34 years). Two themes developed: (i) Positive attitude of HHCs towards TB services provided at home and (ii) HHCs relationship to and acceptance of people living with TB (PLTB). The first main theme emphasized that HHCs appreciated the home visits. Participants preferred home visits because they had negative experiences at the clinic such as delayed waiting times and long queues. HHCs supported the screening of children for TB at home. Participants suggested that the research staff could expand their services by screening for diabetes and hypertension alongside TB screening. In the second main theme, there was a sense of responsibility from the HHCs towards accepting the diagnosis of PLTB and caring for them. A sub-theme that emerged was that as their knowledge on TB disease improved, they accepted the TB status of the PLTB empowering them to take care of the PLTB. CONCLUSIONS: HHCs are supportive of HHCT and felt empowered by receiving TB education that ultimately allowed them to better understand and care for PLTB. HHCs were supportive of screening children for TB at home. Future HHCT activities should consider raising community awareness on the benefits of TB contact tracing at households.",,pubmed

This research aimed to examine whether there were spatiotemporal clusters of ZCL cases, and if so, whether there were differences in clustering according to age, sex, area of residence, and occupation. Spatial analysis, including global and local spatial autocorrelations, inverse distance weighting, and space-time scan statistics, were used to determine potential clusters in the villages of Golestan from 2011-2016. Several spatially significant (p < 0.05) clusters were observed in the north and northeastern regions, and most persisted until the last year of the study period. Children (0-10 years) living in rural settings were more likely to have an infection than those living in other areas. Although the disease was centered in the northern regions, housekeepers, females, and patients aged 21-30 and 41-50 years were found to be the high-risk groups in the southern areas. The seasonal pattern indicated that the outbreak mainly began in late summer, peaked in October, and diminished in December. By exploring spatiotemporal variations of ZCL by sociodemographic information, this study was able to identify priority areas for decision-makers in healthcare and resource allocation.",,pubmed

Plantar ulcers often take months or years to heal, affecting the patient's quality of life. Presence of comorbid conditions in these patients can delay wound healing. The study aimed to evaluate the role of associated comorbid conditions as risk factors in ulcer healing. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 66 leprosy patients with plantar ulcers registered at LEPRA Society-Blue Peter Public Health and Research Center (BPHRC), Hyderabad, India from June 2018 to June 2019 were studied. Comprehensive clinical assessment was done, including screening for comorbid conditions and treated as per the recommended guidelines. About two-thirds of the participants were aged 50 and above, of which more than half were illiterates, and 93.5% were living below the poverty line. Majority of ulcers were seen on the forefoot; with the head of meta-tarsal bone 27 (41.6%) as the commonest site, followed by calcaneum 23 (38.3%) and great toe 10 (16.6%). Mean ulcer depth was 0.61 (0.57) cm, the area was 5.24 (6.73) cm2 and ulcer volume was 4.72 (14.33) cm3. Ulcer dimensions were significantly associated with low body mass index, hypertension and smoking. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Identifying the risk factors delaying wound healing and detailed assessment of ulcers are of profound importance to predict the outcome of plantar ulcers in leprosy patients.

The socio-economic factors were suspected to affect the population of TB notification, we aimed to describe TB case notification rate (CNR) and identify which factors influence TB epidemic are necessary for the prevention and control of the disease in Sichuan province. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study and an ecological spatial analysis was conducted to quantify the presence and location of spatial clusters of TB by the Moran's I index and examined these patterns with socio-economic risk factors by hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal model. RESULTS: A total of 630,009 pulmonary TB cases were notified from 2006 to 2015 in 181 counties of Sichuan province. The CNR decreased year by year since 2007, from 88.70 to 61.37 per 100,000 persons. The spatial heterogeneities of CNR were observed during the study periods. Global Moran's I index varied from 0.23 to 0.44 with all P-value < 0.001. The Bayesian spatio-temporal model with parametric spatio-temporal interactions was chosen as the best model according to the minimum of Deviance Information Criterion (DIC)(19,379.01), and in which the quadratic form of time was taken. The proportion of age group and education year were all associated with CNR after adjusting the spatial effect, temporal effect and spatio-temporal interactions. TB CNR increased by 10.2% [95% credible interval (CI): 6.7-13.7%] for every 1-standard-deviation increase in proportion of age group and decreased by 23% (95% CI: 13.7-32.7%) for every 1-standard-deviation increase in education year. CONCLUSIONS: There were spatial clusters of TB notification rate in Sichuan province from 2006 to 2015, and heavy TB burden was mainly attributed to aging and low socioeconomic status including poor education. Thus, it is more important to pay more attention to the elderly population and improve socioeconomic status including promoting education level in Sichuan province to reduce the TB burden.",,pubmed

We estimated HIV prevalence and assessed progress towards the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets along the HIV treatment cascade in 12 fishing communities surrounding Lakes Edward and George, Uganda. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional household-based survey between September and November 2016. All adults between 15 and 69 years old were eligible to participate. Children below 15 years old were eligible for HIV testing if either parent was HIV-positive. Viral load testing was done for all HIV-infected individuals. Logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic-behavioral variables were used to assess the association between occupation and HIV positivity. RESULTS: Overall, 1738 adults (959 women, 779 men) and 148 children were included. Adult inclusion rate was 96.0%. Of the men, 58% reported to be fishermen. The HIV-prevalence among adults was 17.5% (95%CI: 15.8-19.4) and 6.1% (95%CI: 3.1-11.4) among HIV-exposed children. HIV prevalence was higher among women than among men (20.9% vs. 13.5%, p < 0.001). Among men, fishermen had a higher HIV prevalence (18.7%; 95%CI: 15.1-22.3) and a higher risk of being HIV-positive (aOR: 4.2; 95%CI: 2.0-9.1) than men of other occupations (p < 0.001). Progress towards the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets was as follows: 86.5% (95%CI: 82.3-90.1%) of the HIV-positive participants were diagnosed, 98.7% (95%CI: 96.1-99.6%) of those aware were on antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 87.3% (95%CI: 82.3-91.0%) of those on ART were virally suppressed. Overall, 73% of all HIV-positive individuals were virally suppressed. Viral suppression was lower among individuals 15-24 years (45.5%) than among those 25-44 years (74.0%) and 45-69 years (85.0%), p < 0.001. Fishermen did not to have significant differences in the HIV cascade of care compared to men with other occupations. CONCLUSIONS: HIV prevalence was high in these fishing communities, particularly among women and fishermen. Important progress has been made along the HIV treatment cascade, and the UNAIDS goal for viral suppression in population was achieved. However, gaps remain and HIV care strategies focusing on young people are urgently needed. HIV preventive interventions should target particularly women, young people and fishermen though HIV preventive and care services should remain available to the whole fishing communities.",,pubmed

Burning vegetation, leaves, and other plant products have been shown to be effective mosquito repellents for their vector, Aedes spp., but there has been scant research on whether firewood cooking smoke in households influences mosquito populations or mosquito-borne diseases. About 2.9 billion people worldwide use biomass fuel for household cooking and heating, resulting in an estimated 1.6 million deaths annually from household air pollution (HAP)-related diseases. Global health agencies now encourage households to transition from biomass to clean fuels, but it is unclear whether such interventions may actually increase risk for mosquito-borne diseases. This retrospective case-control study evaluated associations between arboviral infections and cooking with firewood in Santa Rosa, Guatemala. METHOD: Vigilancia Integrada Comunitaria (VICo) was a prospective public health surveillance system for bacterial, parasitic, and viral causes of diarrheal, neurological, respiratory, and febrile illnesses in hospitals and clinics in the department of Santa Rosa, Guatemala. Enrolled VICo in-patients and out-patients during 2011-2018 were interviewed using standardized questionnaires on demographics and household characteristics. Blood and stool specimens were collected and tested to identify the etiologies presenting symptoms. Cases were defined as laboratory-positive for dengue, chikungunya, or Zika virus infections. Controls were laboratory-positive for bacterial and viral diarrheal illnesses (e.g., Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, rotavirus, norovirus, sapovirus, or astrovirus). Cooking with firewood, kitchen location, stove type, and firewood cooking frequency were the independent exposure variables. Logistic regression models were used to analyze unadjusted and adjusted associations between arboviral infections and exposures of interest. RESULT: There were 311 arboviral cases and 1,239 diarrheal controls. Arboviral infections were inversely associated with cooking with firewood in the main house (AOR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.08-0.57), cooking with firewood on an open hearth (AOR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.33-0.78), and cooking with firewood >/=5 times per week (AOR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.36-0.81), adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status index, number of people per household, community population density, community elevation, recruitment location, season, and admission year. CONCLUSION: Several primary determinants of HAP exposure were inversely associated with arboviral infections. Additional studies are needed to understand whether interventions to reduce HAP might actually increase risk for mosquito-borne infectious diseases, which would warrant improved education and mosquito control efforts in conjunction with fuel interventions.",,pubmed

The aims of this study were to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of STB cases and to identify risk factors associated with drug resistance among STB cases in China. We included STB inpatients at Beijing Chest Hospital from January 2009 through December 2018. The multiple demographic and clinical variables of patients were collected from the hospital's electronic patient record. In total, 3086 STB patients were hospitalized in Beijing Chest Hospital. Of these cases, 1988 (64.4%) were spinal TB cases, 991 (32.1%) were joint TB cases, and 107 (3.5%) were concurrent spinal-joint TB cases. The most frequent localization of the infections in joints included the knee (21.5%), hip (17.9%), and elbow (10.3%). For spinal TB, lumbar, thoracic, and cervical spinal TB were present in 51.7%, 40.6%, and 4.4% of cases, respectively. Positive cultures were reported in only 16.0% of STB cases. When patients aged >/= 60 years old were used as the control group, youths (< 18 years old) were less likely to have spinal TB (aOR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.21-0.41). The prevalence of MDR-TB was 12.5% among the STB cases, and more female cases were afflicted with drug-resistant STB than with drug-susceptible STB (aOR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.27-0.94). In addition, patients aged < 18 years had significantly higher odds of having drug-resistant STB compared with those aged >/= 60 years (aOR, 20.778; 95% CI, 4.49-96.149). In conclusion, our data demonstrate that spinal TB is the most frequent form of STB in China. The youths are less likely to have spinal TB compared with elderly patients, while the patients aged < 18 years have significantly higher odds of having drug-resistant STB than elderly patients.",,pubmed

Thus, household contact investigation may serve a dual purpose of screening for both tuberculosis and diabetes mellitus among household contacts. We therefore aimed to evaluate the coverage of screening for tuberculosis and diabetes mellitus among household contacts of tuberculosis index cases and to determine predictors of tuberculosis screening. METHODS: A household-based survey was conducted in February 2019 in Muang district of Phatthalung Province, Thailand where 95 index tuberculosis patients were newly diagnosed with pulmonary or pleural tuberculosis between October 2017 and September 2018. Household contacts of the index patients were interviewed using a structured questionnaire to ascertain their past-year history of tuberculosis screening and, if appropriate, diabetes mellitus screening. For children, the household head or an adult household member was interviewed as a proxy. Coverage of tuberculosis screening at the household level was regarded as households having all contacts screened for tuberculosis. Logistic regression and mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to determine predictors of tuberculosis screening at the household and individual levels, respectively, with the strengths of association presented as adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Of 61 responding households (64%), complete coverage of tuberculosis screening at the household level was 34.4% and among the 174 household contacts was 46.6%. About 20% of contacts did not receive any recommendation for tuberculosis screening. Households were more likely to have all members screened for tuberculosis if they were advised to be screened by a healthcare professional rather than someone else. At the individual level, contacts aged >/=35 years (AOR: 30.6, 95% CI: 2.0-466.0), being an employee (AOR: 0.1, 95% CI: 0.0-0.8) and those who had lived more than 5 years in the same household (AOR: 0.1, 95% CI: 0.0-0.8) were independent predictors for tuberculosis screening. Coverage of diabetes mellitus screening was 80.6% with lack of awareness being the main reason for not being screened. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to diabetes screening, the coverage of tuberculosis screening was low. A better strategy to improve coverage of tuberculosis contact screening is needed.",,pubmed

Many approaches to RCD assume detectable infections are clustered within and around homes of passively detected cases (index households), which has been evaluated in a number of settings with disparate results. METHODS: Household questionnaires and diagnostic testing were conducted following RCD investigations in Zanzibar, Tanzania, including the index household and up to 9 additional neighboring households. RESULTS: Of 12,487 participants tested by malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT), 3.2% of those residing in index households and 0.4% of those residing in non-index households tested positive (OR = 8.4; 95%CI: 5.7, 12.5). Of 6,281 participants tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), 8.4% of those residing in index households and 1.3% of those residing in non-index households tested positive (OR = 7.1; 95%CI: 6.1, 10.9). Within households of index cases defined as imported, odds of qPCR-positivity amongst members reporting recent travel were 1.4 times higher than among those without travel history (95%CI: 0.2, 4.4). Amongst non-index households, odds of qPCR-detectable infection were no different between households located within 50 m of the index household as compared with those located farther away (OR = 0.8, 95%CI: 0.5, 1.4). Sensitivity of RDT to detect qPCR-detectable infections was 34% (95%CI: 26.4, 42.3). CONCLUSIONS: Malaria prevalence in index households in Zanzibar is much higher than in non-index households, in which prevalence is very low. Travelers represent a high-risk population. Low sensitivity of RDTs due to a high prevalence of low-density infections results in an RCD system missing a large proportion of the parasite reservoir.",,pubmed

Unfortunately, aggressive insecticide-spraying campaigns have not been able to eliminate domestic infestation of Triatoma dimidiata, the native vector in Guatemala. To target interventions toward houses most at risk of infestation, comprehensive socioeconomic and entomologic surveys were conducted in two towns in Jutiapa, Guatemala. Given the exhaustively large search space associated with combinations of risk factors, traditional statistics are limited in their ability to discover risk factor interactions. Two recently developed statistical evolutionary algorithms, specifically designed to accommodate risk factor interactions and heterogeneity, were applied to this large combinatorial search space and used in tandem to identify sets of risk factor combinations associated with infestation. The optimal model includes 10 risk factors in what is known as a third-order disjunctive normal form (i.e., infested households have chicken coops AND deteriorated bedroom walls OR an accumulation of objects AND dirt floors AND total number of occupants >/= 5 AND years of electricity >/= 5 OR poor hygienic condition ratings AND adobe walls AND deteriorated walls AND dogs). Houses with dirt floors and deteriorated walls have been reported previously as risk factors and align well with factors currently targeted by Ecohealth interventions to minimize infestation. However, the tandem evolutionary algorithms also identified two new socioeconomic risk factors (i.e., households having many occupants and years of electricity >/= 5). Identifying key risk factors may help with the development of new Ecohealth interventions and/or reduce the survey time needed to identify houses most at risk.",,pubmed

This is a descriptive cross-sectional study based on data retrieved from medical records. To achieve this, we used a questionnaire composed of sociodemographic and clinical information recorded from patients aged between thirteen and fifty-nine years who attended a specialized service from 2007 to 2014. The chi-square test was performed to verify the association of the outcome with the categorical variables. Continuous variables were compared through the Student t-test. Thirteen variables were analyzed in the bivariate model, resulting in the selection of the following variables to the multivariate model (p<0.20) age of discovery (p=0.12), age (p=0.14), skin color (p=0.12), level of education (p=0.03), time since HIV diagnosis (p<0.001) and AIDS case (p<0.001). Among the six variables selected for the multivariate model, cases of aids (p<0.001) remained significant. We concluded that having aids decreases the probability of non-adherence to antiretroviral treatment by 92%.

Study of a prospective cohort of 358 HIV-negative MSM, aged 18 years and over, reporting having had at least one oral or anal relationship with another man during the last 12 months, prior to recruitment. The monitoring lasted 30 months with a follow-up visit every six months. Univariate analyses and a Cox proportional hazards multivariate regression were used to examine the association between bio-behavioral, socio-demographic and knowledge-related characteristics with HIV incidence. The retention rate for the follow-up of the 358 participants was 94.5%. On the 813.5 person-years of follow-up, 48 seroconversions with an HIV incidence of 5.91 per 100 person-years were observed (95% CI: 4.46-7.85). Factors associated with the high risk of HIV were age (HR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2-0.8), living in couple (HR = 0.5 95% CI: 0.2-0.96) and the lack of condom systematic use with a male partner during high-risk sex (HR = 3.9; 95% CI: 1.4-11.1).

The methodology included a search for studies according to a structured protocol using the scientific platforms, such as Scielo and PubMed. The references of each identified article were who referred to CL determinants were further screened, and so on. We extracted information from 41 articles and the determinants were grouped accordingly. Two measures were evaluated as follows: a) the frequency of citations of the determinants; and b) the proportion of determinants identified as having ""significant association in analytical studies"" with respect to the total number of determinants analyzed in other analytical studies using the same concept. The analyzed articles covered most of the regions of Brazil and 7 other countries bordering Brazil. We found 43 concepts of determinants. However, the final selection resulted in the identification of 14 major determinants. These results therefore contribute in the identification of major CL determinants and this information can be used to establish strategies for identifying risk prone areas for disease surveillance.",,pubmed

R. China). To develop specific interventions towards this population, the present study was designed to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) towards schistosomiasis of fishermen and boatmen, and to identify the risk factors associated with schistosome infection using a molecular technique in a selected area of Hunan Province in P. R. China. METHODS: A cross sectional survey was conducted in the Dongting Lake Basin of Yueyang County, Hunan Province. A total of 601 fishermen and boatmen were interviewed between October and November 2017. Information regarding sociodemographic details and KAPs towards schistosomiasis were collected using a standardized questionnaire. Fecal samples of participants were collected and tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore the risk factors related to the positive results of PCR. RESULTS: Of the 601 respondents, over 90% knew schistosomiasis and how the disease was contracted, the intermediate host of schistosomes and preventive methods. The majority of respondents had a positive attitude towards schistosomiasis prevention. However, only 6.66% (40/601) of respondents had installed a latrine on their boats, while 32.61% (196/601) of respondents defecated in the public toilets on shore. In addition, only 4.99% (30/601) respondents protected themselves while exposed to freshwater. The prevalence of schistosomiasis, as determined by PCR, among fishermen and boatmen in Yueyang County was 13.81% (83/601). Age, years of performing the current job, number of times receiving treatment, and whether they were treated in past three years were the main influencing factors of PCR results among this population. CONCLUSIONS: Fishermen and boatmen are still at high risk of infection in P. R. China and gaps exist in KAPs towards schistosomiasis in this population group. Chemotherapy, and health education encouraging behavior change in combination with other integrated approaches to decrease the transmission risk in environments should be improved.",,pubmed

The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution and determinants of T. pallidum infection in the region. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study of 2608 participants aged >/=14 years was conducted in a rural area of southwestern China in 2014-15. A pretested questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic characteristics and other factors associated with T. pallidum infection. The diagnoses of T. pallidum, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections were determined by commercial test kits. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the correlates for T. pallidum infection, and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: The prevalence of T. pallidum infection was 1.2% (95% CI 0.8 to 1.7%). Risk factors varied by gender. In the male group, T. pallidum infection was significantly associated with ever injection drug use (aOR = 9.42, 95% CI 2.47 to 35.87) and HCV infection (aOR = 13.28, 95% CI 3.20 to 51.70).

Therefore, there is little information on clinical factors related to HIV infection in older persons (>45 years old). In this study, data on CD4 lymphocyte counts were analyzed on adults who are linked to care and have their first CD4 cell count done from different regions of the Republic of Panama from 2012 to 2017. Samples were grouped according to late presentation status, region of origin in the country, year, gender, and age groups. Factors associated with late presentation to care and advanced HIV were assessed on each group by multivariable logistic regression. Late presentation to care was observed in 71.6% of the evaluated subjects, and advanced HIV in 54.5%. Late presentation was associated with males (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.1-1.6, p = 0.03), age greater than 45 years old (AOR = 2.3 CI= 1.8-2.9, p < 0.001), and being from regions where antiretroviral clinics are not well instituted (AOR = 2.1, CI = 1.6-2.7, p < 0.001). Despite an increase in subjects linked to care with a CD4 test performed over the years, late presentation remained constant. Therefore, prevention policies must be reformulated. Promotion of routine HIV testing, accessibility among all population groups, installation of antiretroviral clinics, and implementation of programs as rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy should be rolled out nationally.",,pubmed

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving 112 pregnant women with HIV infection receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Data including viral load, complete blood analysis, and CD4 counts were extracted from medical records. An inquiry form was used to collect data on socioeconomic status and frequency of food intake. Pre-gestational weight was calculated based on pregnancy weight to obtain the body mass index (BMI) and weight gain for gestational age according the US Institute of Medicine. Of the study population, 68.7% were in consensual union, 31.3% were single, and 33.9% belonged to the two lowest socioeconomic strata. The median age and CD4 count were 27 (interquartile range [IQR]: 23-32) years and 418 (IQR: 267-591), respectively. The adequacy of energy was 91.8% (IQR: 74.1-117.7). The median energy intake from protein was 13.5% (IQR: 12.2-14.9) and from lipids, 35.5% (IQR: 31.1-40.3). Pregnant women with gastrointestinal symptoms and CD4 count <350 were seven times more likely to have folate deficiency (odds ratio [OR] 7.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-38.1; p = 0.009) and six times more likely to have poor zinc intake (OR 6.7, 95% CI 1.3-36.8; p = 0.014). In all, 42.9% of the pregnant women consumed iron and folic acid supplements and 54.4% consumed multivitamin supplements. Moreover, 45.5% had a normal pre-gestational BMI, 41.1% were classified overweight, and 13.4% had obesity, whereas 62.5% showed insufficient gestational weight gain, and 18.8% experienced weight loss. The variables associated with insufficient weight gain were consensual union (OR 5.3, 95% CI 1.9-15.0; p = 0.002) and belonging to the lowest socioeconomic stratum (E) (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.0-9.2; p = 0.046).

Although there are few primary studies that reported diversified magnitudes of health seeking behavior among presumptive TB patients in Ethiopia, there is no review study that attempted to summarize the available evidence. Thus, this review was aimed to estimate the proportion of health care seeking behavior from health facility and to summarize the reasons why individuals with presumptive TB are not seeking health care in Ethiopia. METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis study was conducted on primary studies that reported proportion of health seeking behavior among presumptive TB patients. Electronic databases: PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct were searched to retrieve studies published in English language from Ethiopia without restricting publication year. In addition, bibliographies of included studies were also screened to retrieve potential studies. The keywords ""health seeking"", ""health seeking behavior"", ""TB suspects"" and ""presumptive TB"" were used both in Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) and free text. Random effects meta-analysis model was used to estimate the pooled proportions of health care seeking and not seeking behaviors. Stata version 14 was used for data analysis. RESULT: Five studies which involved 3230 patients with presumptive TB were included into this review. The pooled estimated proportion of health care seeking behavior among presumptive TB patients from health facilities was 65% (95% CI, 54-76%), while the pooled proportion of not seeking health care from any sources was 17% (95% CI;6-27%). In addition, 18% (95% CI; 5-30%) of presumptive TB patients were seeking health care from inappropriate sources. Being female, younger age, low income status, absence of previous TB treatment history, low education status were the risk factors that associated with low health care seeking behavior. CONCLUSION: Considerable proportion of patients with presumptive TB were not seeking health care from health facilities or seeks care from inappropriate sources in Ethiopia. Implementing efforts that could improve health care seeking behavior is vital to prevent prolonged disease transmission through immediate treatment commencement.",,pubmed

Therefore, studies on this species provide important data for public health. Thus, the objective of the present study was to ascertain the seroprevalence of canine VL (CVL) and the associated factors in the Brejo Paraibano microregion, northeastern Brazil. A total of 409 dogs were sampled from the eight municipalities of the microregion: Alagoa Grande, Alagoa Nova, Areia, Bananeiras, Borborema, Matinhas, Piloes and Serraria. The diagnosis of CVL was made using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA S7(R)), through which the prevalence observed was 29.3%. By robust Poisson regression analysis two factors were associated with seroprevalence: illiterate/incomplete elementary owner's education level (prevalence ratio = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.05-2.34; p-value = 0.027) and tick infestation (prevalence ratio = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.27-2.61; p-value = 0.001). It is concluded that the seroprevalence of CVL in the Brejo Paraibano microregion is high. The factors associated with seroprevalence indicated the importance to develop socioeducational actions on the population, and the finding that tick infestation was associated with seroprevalence shows that there is a need for investigation regarding the role of ticks in the epidemiology of CVL.",,pubmed

In order to identify these areas, the authors prepared an index of vulnerability to severe cases of COVID-19 based on the construction, weighting, and integration of three levels of information: mean number of residents per household and density of persons 60 years or older (both per census tract) and neighborhood tuberculosis incidence rate in the year 2018. The data on residents per household and density of persons 60 years or older were obtained from the 2010 Population Census, and data on tuberculosis incidence were taken from the Brazilian Information System for Notificable Diseases (SINAN). Weighting of the indicators comprising the index used analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and the levels of information were integrated via weighted linear combination with map algebra. Spatialization of the index of vulnerability to severe COVID-19 in the city of Rio de Janeiro reveals the existence of more vulnerable areas in different parts of the city's territory, reflecting its urban complexity. The areas with greatest vulnerability are located in the North and West Zones of the city and in poor neighborhoods nested within upper-income parts of the South and West Zones. Understanding these conditions of vulnerability can facilitate the development of strategies to monitor the evolution of COVID-19 and orient measures for prevention and health promotion.",,pubmed

DESIGN: Literature review, qualitative research and situational analysis. DATA SOURCES: Search of electronic bibliographic databases, national repositories of documentation from 1998 to 2018. Search keywords included Madagascar, HIV, sexually transmitted infections, men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers (SWs), transactional sex (TS), injecting drug users (IDUs), vulnerability and sexual behaviour. Qualitative sources were interviews and focus group discussions. REVIEW METHODS: Studies focused on HIV and/or vulnerability of HIV in Madagascar in general, and key populations (KPs) and HIV/AIDS response were taken into account. National reports from key HIV response actors were included. RESULTS: Madagascar is characterised by a low HIV/AIDS epidemic profile in the general population (GP) (0.3%) combined with a high prevalence of HIV among KPs (SWs, MSM and IDUs).An increase in HIV prevalence among KP has been observed during recent years. Hospital-based data suggest an increase in HIV prevalence among the GP. The vulnerability traits are inconsistent use of condoms, multipartner relationships and other contextual factors like widespread TS and gender inequality. A high prevalence/incidence of sexually transmitted infections could indicate a high vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. However, there are no reports of HIV prevalence of >1% in antenatal consultation. CONCLUSION: There is not enough evidence to make a conclusion about the HIV epidemiological situation in Madagascar due to the scarcity of the epidemiological data. However, Madagascar may be closer to a turning point towards a high-prevalence epidemic with severe consequences, particularly when taking into account its socioeconomical fragility and underlying vulnerabilities. More precise epidemiological data and improved HIV/AIDS diagnosis and case management should be a public health priority.",,pubmed

It is particularly prevalent in prisons in sub-Saharan Africa due to overcrowding, malnutrition, high HIV prevalence and insufficient medical services. Prisoners have experienced worse TB treatment outcomes than the general population. The researchers investigated the TB treatment outcomes and predictors of unsuccessful treatment outcomesamong prisoners and the general population in Zomba, Malawi. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed TB registers of prisoners and the general population diagnosed with TB from January 2011 to December 2016 at Zomba Maximum Central Prison and Zomba Central Hospital, Malawi. The study used routinely collected data extracted from national, standardized TB treatment monitoring tools. Successful treatment outcome was classified as the total for cured and completed treatment while unsuccessful treatment outcome was classified as the total of deaths and treatment failures. We used descriptive statistics to compare the demographics and TB treatment parameters among prisoners and non - prisoners and computed multivariate analysis to predict the independent factors of unsuccessful treatment outcomes. RESULTS: Of 1652 registered cases, 27% were prisoners (all males) and 72% were non-prisoners (58% males). The median age was 35 years (IQR: 29-42); 76% were Pulmonary TB cases (78% among prisoners vs 75% among general population); 83% were new TB cases (77% among prisoners vs 86% among general population); and 65% were HIV positive (50% among prisoners vs 71% among general population). Regarding treatment outcome, 1472 (89%) were cured and/or completed treatment (93% among prisoners vs 88% among general population), 2(0.2%) were treatment failures, 122 (8%) died (5% among prisoners vs 8% among general population) and 55 (3%) were not evaluated (1% among prisoners vs 4% among general population). Unsuccessful TB treatment outcomes were associated with age greater than 35 years (aOR = 0.68: 95% C.I: 0.58-0.80), Extra-Pulmonary TB (aOR = 1.69: 95% C.I: 1.08-2.63) andHIV positive status (aOR = 0.63: 95% C.I: 0.42-0.94). CONCLUSION: Maximum prisons provide a stable population that can be easily monitored throughout the course of TB treatment. Good TB treatment outcomes which are comparable to the general population can be achieved among Malawian prisoners despite the challenging prison conditions.",,pubmed

Understanding FBWs' risk profiles is central to designing targeted HIV prevention interventions for them. This systematic review describes the socio-demographic characteristics and risk factors for HIV transmission among FBWs in SSA. METHODS: We searched six databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Popline, Embase and additionally the World Health Organization's WHOLIS database for grey literature between July and September 2017. Inclusion criteria were reporting (1) primary socio-demographic or behavioral data; on (2) women who sold or delivered drinks to clients; (3) in establishments serving alcohol; (4) in SSA. We excluded studies not presenting separate data on FBWs. We extracted quantitative and qualitative data from the selected studies and conducted a qualitative synthesis of findings. RESULTS: We found 4565 potentially eligible articles, including duplicates. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, we retained 19 articles. FBWs often migrated from rural to urban areas due to economic need or social marginalization. They began bar-based transactional sex due to low wages, peer pressure and to increase financial independence. FBWs had high HIV risk awareness but low agency to negotiate condom use, particularly with regular partners or when offered higher prices for condomless sex. FBWs were also vulnerable to violence and stigmatization. CONCLUSIONS: FBWs are a vulnerable population for HIV infection. Despite social stigmatization and elevated risk of contracting STIs, bar work remains attractive because it enables unskilled women to both, make a living and maintain some independence. FBWs face HIV-related risk factors at the individual, community and societal level and may benefit from biomedical, behavioral and structural interventions.",,pubmed

However, there are few studies focused on foreigners living in China. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and socio-demographic distribution of HIV, HBV, HCV, and T. pallidum among foreigners in Guangzhou in the period of 2010-2017. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to screen serological samples of 40,935 foreigners from 2010 to 2017 at the Guangdong International Travel Health Care Center in Guangzhou. Samples were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-HCV, syphilis antibody (anti-TPPA) and anti-HIV 1 and 2. We collected secondary data from laboratory records and used multiple logistic regression analyses to verify the association between different factors and the seroprevalence of HIV/HBV/HCV/ T. pallidum. RESULTS: The prevalence of HBV/HCV/HIV/ T. pallidum was 2.30, 0.42, 0.02, and 0.60%, respectively, and fluctuated slightly for 7 years. The results of multiple logistic regression showed that males were less susceptible to HBV than females (odds ratio [OR] = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67-0.89). Participants under the age of 20 had a lower risk of HBV (OR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.18-0.35), HCV (OR = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.02-0.18), and T. pallidum (OR = 0. 10, 95% CI: 0.05-0.20) than participants over the age of 50. Participants with an education level below high school were more likely to have HBV (OR = 2.98, 95% CI: 1.89-4.70) than others, and businessmen (OR = 3.02, 95% CI: 2.03-4.49), and designers (OR = 3.83, 95% CI: 2.49-5.90) had a higher risk of T. pallidum than others. Co-infection involved 58 (4.20%) total cases, and the highest co-infection rate was observed for HBV and T. pallidum (2.60%). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HBV/HCV/HIV/ T. pallidum was low among foreigners in Guangzhou. Region, gender, age, educational level, and occupation were risk factors for positive infection.",,pubmed

In recent years, in China, DF still poses an increasing threat to public health in many cities; but the incidence shows significant spatiotemporal differences. The purpose of this study was to identify the key factors affecting the spatial and temporal distribution of DF. We collected natural environmental and socio-economic data for two adjacent cities, Guangzhou (73 variables) and Foshan (71 variables), with the most DF cases in China. We performed random forest modelling to rank the factors according to their level of importance, and used negative binomial regression analysis to compare the risk factors between outbreak years and non-outbreak years. The natural environmental factors contributing to DF incidence for Guangzhou were temperature (relative risk (RR) = 18.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.11-113.67), humidity (RR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.17-2.90) and green area (RR = 12.11, 95% CI = 6.14-55.50), and for Foshan was forest coverage (RR = 5.83, 95% CI = 2.72-12.45). Socio-economic impact were shown in Guangzhou with foreign visitor (RR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.05-1.34) and oversea air passenger transport (RR = 7.34, 95% CI = 2.26-23.86); in Foshan, with oversea tourism (RR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.34-2.04); and in Guangzhou-Foshan, with the development of intercity metro (RR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.10-1.44). The difference between the two cities was the greater impact of the foreign visitor, green spaces and climate factor on DF in Guangzhou; the impact of the construction of intercity metro; and the more significant impact of oversea tourism on DF in Foshan. Our results suggest meaningful clues to public health authorities implementing joint interventions on DF prevention and early warning, to increase health education on DF prevention for international visitors and oversea travelers, and cross-city metro passengers; using rapid body temperature detection in public places such as airports, metros and parks can help detect cases early.",,pubmed

In Sri Lanka, cutaneous leishmaniasis is the most common form of the disease. It is prevalent in dry and intermediate zones, mostly associated with rural settings. Understanding basic risk factors is critical in the management of the disease with effective interventions. This study is focused on assessing the demographic, socioeconomic and landscape factors associated with leishmaniasis in Kurunegala District, Sri Lanka. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted. Households of the past patients and randomly selected households, which had no history of leishmaniasis cases were interviewed. The clinical, socioeconomic, demographic, landscape and awareness-related data were obtained using a pre-tested, interviewer-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients and a similar number of controls were included in the study. All the patients had the cutaneous form of the disease. Housewives and personnel with monthly incomes less than Rs. 10,000 (56.76 USD) were 3.9- and 9.5-times more prone to the disease, respectively, according to multivariate analysis. Presence of decaying garbage, termite hills, unclear areas, wet soil and gardening areas were always associated with the increased odds of acquiring the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Demographic factors do not play a pivotal role in the prevalence of leishmaniasis in the area. Housewives, inhabitants with low incomes and individuals who live in areas with conditions suitable for sand fly breeding and resting are major groups with a higher risk of infection. Special attention must be given in raising awareness and environmental management in control activities.",,pubmed

However, the impact of tuberculosis on global cancer burden is unknown. METHODS: We performed random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions of studies reporting the association between tuberculosis and cancer risks by searching PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane library, and CINAHL from inception to 1 June 2019. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) of cancer incidence attributable to tuberculosis were calculated using relative risks from our meta-analyses and tuberculosis prevalence data from Global Health Data Exchange by age, sex, and country. The study has been registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016050691). RESULTS: Fourty nine studies with 52,480 cancer cases met pre-specified inclusion criteria. Tuberculosis was associated with head and neck cancer (RR 2.64[95% CI 2.00-3.48]), hepatobiliary cancer (2.43[1.82-3.25]), Hodgkin's lymphoma (2.19[1.62-2.97]), lung cancer (1.69[1.46-1.95]), gastrointestinal cancer (1.62[1.26-2.08]), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (1.61[1.34-1.94]), pancreatic cancer (1.58[1.28-1.96]), leukaemia (1.55[1.25-1.93]), kidney and bladder cancer (1.54[1.21-1.97]), and ovarian cancer (1.43[1.04-1.97]). We estimated that 2.33%(1.14-3.81) or 381,035(187145-623,404) of global cancer incidences in 2015 were attributable to tuberculosis. The PAFs varied by Socio-demographic Index (SDI)-ranging from 1.28% (0.57-2.31%) in the high-SDI countries to 3.51% (1.84-5.42%) in the middle-SDI countries. Individually, China and India accounted for 47% of all tuberculosis-related cancer cases. CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis is associated with increased risk of cancer at ten sites. The burden of tuberculosis attributable cancer skewed towards lower resource countries. Research priorities are to better understand regional disparities and underlying mechanism linking tuberculosis and cancer development.",,pubmed
A449,Is there gender inequality in the epidemiological profile of tuberculosis?,,Ben Jmaa M; Ben Ayed H; Koubaa M; Hammami F; Damak J; Ben Jemaa M,2020.0,La Tunisie medicale,"BACKGROUND: Worldwide, many more males than females were diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) and died from it globally. In light of this, examining the gender differences among patients with TB is crucial to institute effective prevention, coverage and treatment. AIM: To analyze gender differences in the epidemiological, clinical and evolutionary specificities of TB in Southern Tunisia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study including all new cases of TB of any age, diagnosed between January 1995 and December 2016. Data were collected from the regional register of TB at the Center of Tuberculosis Control of Sfax, Southern Tunisia. RESULTS: We recorded 2771 new cases of TB. The sex ratio was 1.2. We noted 1160 new cases with pulmonary TB (PTB) (41.9%). Males were more likely to have PTB than females (Odds Ratio (OR)=2.5;p<0.001), while extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB) was more common in females (OR=0.4;p<0.001). Lymph node (OR=2.6;p<0.001), cutaneous (OR=2.3;p<0.001) and abdominal TB (OR=2;p<0.001) were significantly more frequent in females. Pleural TB was significantly more common in males (OR=1.2; p<0.001). Case fatality rate was significantly higher in males (OR=1.7;p=0.02). Females experienced recovery more frequently (OR=1.3;p=0.04). Treatment duration was significantly higher in females (8.88+/-3.6months vs.8.41+/-3.2months; p<0.001). Between 1995 and 2016, the age standardized notification rate (ASNR) of TB (Rho=0.68; p<0.001) and EPTB (Rho=0.59 p=0.003) had significantly increased in females, while it had not significantly changed in males. CONCLUSION: Our study highlighted higher burden and morbidity in males in TB cases in Southern Tunisia. National TB programs should actively focus on these facts with more routine diagnostic and screening targeting males.",,pubmed

Several factors have been associated with the risk of Leishmania infantum infection in dogs. However, dog owner characteristics have been rarely explored. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence and to identify the associated factors for VL infection including dog owners characteristics. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted including dogs from an endemic canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) region in the Federal District, Brazil. The infection was detected using parasitological, serological, and molecular methods. The associated factors were identified through Poisson regression modelling. FINDINGS: The prevalence of infection was 26.25% [95% confidence interval (CI): 20.05 to 33.57]. The associated factors were: short coat prevalence ratio (PR) = 2.33 (95% CI: 1.02 to 5.22); presence of backyard with predominance of soil and/or vegetation PR = 4.15 (95% CI: 1.35 to 12.77); and highest gross family income score PR = 2.03 (95% CI: 1.16 to 3.54). MAIN CONCLUSION: This is the first study that relates higher socioeconomic status of dog owners as an independent factor associated with higher prevalence of VL infection, along with other strongly associated factors related to receptive environment for phlebotomines.

The aim of this study was to develop and test a risk prediction tool for PHIV who are at risk of not achieving viral suppression after a year of being in care. We used retrospective data to develop an integer-based scoring method using backward stepwise logistic regression. We also developed risk score categories based on the quartiles of the total risk score. The risk prediction tool was internally validated by bootstrapping. We found that nonviral suppression after a year of being in care among PHIV can be predicted using seven variables, namely, age group, race, federal poverty level, current AIDS status, current homelessness status, problematic alcohol/drug use, and current viral suppression status. Those in the high-risk category had about a 23 increase in the odds of nonviral suppression compared with the low-risk group. The risk prediction tool has good discriminative performance and calibration. Our findings suggest that nonviral suppression after a year of being in care can be predicted using easily available variables. In settings with similar demographics, the risk prediction tool can assist health care providers in identifying high-risk individuals to target for intervention. Follow-up studies are required to externally validate this risk prediction tool.",,pubmed

METHODS: Data were collected from 1687 AGYW aged 10-14 years (n = 606) and 15-22 years (n = 1081), randomly selected from a general population census in Korogocho and Viwandani in 2017, as part of an impact evaluation of the ""DREAMS"" Partnership. For 10-14 year-olds, we measured violence experienced either in the past 6 months or ever using a different set of questions from those used for 15-22 year-olds. Among 15-22 year-olds we measured prevalence of violence, experienced in the past 12 months, using World Health Organization (WHO) definitions for violence typologies. Predictors of violence were identified using multivariable logit models. RESULTS: Among 606 girls aged 10-14 years, about 54% and 7% ever experienced psychological and sexual violence, respectively. About 33%, 16% and 5% experienced psychological, physical and sexual violence in the past 6 months. The 10-14 year old girls who engaged in chores or activities for payment in the past 6 months, or whose family did not have enough food due to lack of money were at a greater risk for violence. Invitation to DREAMS and being a non-Christian were protective. Among 1081 AGYW aged 15-22 years, psychological violence was the most prevalent in the past year (33.1%), followed by physical violence (22.9%), and sexual violence (15.8%). About 7% experienced all three types of violence. Severe physical violence was more prevalent (13.8%) than moderate physical violence (9.2%). Among AGYW aged 15-22 years, being previously married/lived with partner, engaging in employment last month, food insecure were all risk factors for psychological violence. For physical violence, living in Viwandani and being a Muslim were protective; while being previously married or lived with a partner, or sleeping hungry at night during the past 4 weeks were risk factors. The odds of sexual violence were lower among AGYW aged 18-22 years and among Muslims. Engaging in sex and food insecurity increased chances for sexual violence. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of recent violence among AGYW is high in this population. This calls for increased effort geared towards addressing drivers of violence as an early entry point of HIV prevention effort in this vulnerable group.",,pubmed

The virus activity has recently been frequently reported in Kassala State, eastern Sudan. However, an appropriate epidemiological study would be necessary to provide accurate and precise estimates of the magnitude of recent DENV transmission in this area of endemicity. METHODS: In the present investigation, a cross sectional study was conducted to advance beyond the current knowledge of the epidemiology of the disease in Kassala State. The prevalence of the disease was estimated and associated risk factors were determined. Sampled sera were collected and screened for recent dengue transmissionas as determined by DENV-IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The collection of data for risk assessment was supported by a well designed structured questionnaire. RESULTS: The prevalence of recent DENV infection was estimated to be (11.42%). Potential risk factors to DENV seropsitivity include, age (OR = 3.24, CI = 1.81-5.77,p-value = 0.001); low income (OR = 3.75, CI = 1.57-8.93, p-value = 0.027); mosquito control (OR = 4.18, CI = 2.33-7.51, p-value = 0.004); and localities. CONCLUSION: The present study showed a high rate of circulating DENV IgM antibodies among the participants of the study (11.42%), suggesting recent transmission of DENV in Kassala State, eastern Sudan.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to find the factors associated with HIV infection and correlate the association between HIV status and self-assessed risk to HIV among IDUs in Manipur. METHODS: National Integrated Biological and Behavioral Surveillance (2014-2015) data were used for the study; all analyses done were weighted. In Manipur, information was collected from 1594 IDUs during the surveillance between 2014 and 2015 across four domains, namely Chandel (396), Imphal East (397), Thoubal (401), and Senapati (400). Chi-square test was performed to test the association between the independent and dependent variables. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors associated with HIV positivity. RESULTS: Higher age, unsafe injecting practice, low education status, and low-income status were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with HIV infection among IDUs in Manipur. Self-assessed risk of HIV infection by IDU was significantly associated with HIV positivity. CONCLUSION: Interventions among IDUs in Manipur should focus on emphasizing safe injecting practices along with creating awareness on HIV prevention and management.",,pubmed

Although the incidence and deaths from TB have decreased in Brazil in recent years, the disease has increased in the vulnerable population, whose diagnosis is more delayed and the chances for abandonment and deaths are significantly higher. This study aimed to identify high-risk areas for TB mortality and evidence their social determinants through a sensitive tailored social index, in a context of high inequality in South Brazil. METHODS: A multistep statistical methodology was developed, based on spatial clustering, categorical principal components analysis, and receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC). This study considered 138 spatial units in Curitiba, South Brazil. TB deaths (2008-2015) were obtained from the National Information Mortality System and social variables from the Brazilian Human Development Atlas (2013). RESULTS: There were 128 TB deaths recorded in the study: the mortality rate was 0.9/100,000 inhabitants, minimum-maximum: 0-25.51/100,000, with a mean (standard deviation) of 1.07 (2.71), and 78 space units had no deaths. One risk cluster of TB mortality was found in the south region (RR=2.64, p=0.01). Considering the social variables, several clusters were identified in the social risk indicator (SRI): income (899.82/1752.94; 0.024), GINI Index (0.41/0.45; 0.010), and overcrowding (25.07/15.39; 0.032). The SRI showed a high capacity to discriminate the TB mortality areas (area under ROC curve 0.865, 95% CI: 0.796-0.934). CONCLUSIONS: A powerful risk map (SRI) was developed, allowing tailored and personalised interventions. The south of Curitiba was identified as a high-risk area for TB mortality and the majority of social variables. This methodological approach can be generalised to other areas and/or other public health problems.",,pubmed

OBJECTIVE: To estimate new case detection rates of leprosy among household contacts of patients with previously diagnosed leprosy and to investigate its associated risk factors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based cohort study included families registered in the 100 Million Brazilian Cohort linked with nationwide registries of leprosy; data were collected from January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2014. Household contacts of patients with a previous diagnosis of leprosy from each household unit were followed up from the time of detection of the primary case to the time of detection of a subsequent case or until December 31, 2014. Data analysis was performed from May to December 2018. EXPOSURES: Clinical characteristics of the primary case and sociodemographic factors of the household contact. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incidence of leprosy, estimated as the new case detection rate of leprosy per 100 000 household contacts at risk (person-years at risk). The association between occurrence of a subsequent leprosy case and the exposure risk factors was assessed using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regressions allowing for state- and household-specific random effects. RESULTS: Among 42 725 household contacts (22 449 [52.5%] female; mean [SD] age, 22.4 [18.5] years) of 17 876 patients detected with leprosy, the new case detection rate of leprosy was 636.3 (95% CI, 594.4-681.1) per 100 000 person-years at risk overall and 521.9 (95% CI, 466.3-584.1) per 100 000 person-years at risk among children younger than 15 years. Household contacts of patients with multibacillary leprosy had higher odds of developing leprosy (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.48; 95% CI, 1.17-1.88), and the odds increased among contacts aged 50 years or older (adjusted OR, 3.11; 95% CI, 2.03-4.76). Leprosy detection was negatively associated with illiterate or preschool educational level (adjusted OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38-0.92). For children, the odds were increased among boys (adjusted OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.20-2.42). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings in this Brazilian population-based cohort study suggest that the household contacts of patients with leprosy may have increased risk of leprosy, especially in households with existing multibacillary cases and older contacts. Public health interventions, such as contact screening, that specifically target this population appear to be needed.",,pubmed

Knowledge of risk factors is required to address LTFU. In this systematic review, risk factors for LTFU are identified and meta-analyses performed. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Psycinfo and Cochrane were searched for studies that report on potential risk factors for LTFU in adults who initiated ART in LMICs. Meta-analysis was performed for risk factors evaluated by at least five studies. Pooled effect estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using random effect models with inverse variance weights. Risk of bias was assessed and sensitivity analyses performed. RESULTS: Eighty studies were included describing a total of 1 605 320 patients of which 87.4% from sub-Saharan Africa. The following determinants were significantly associated with an increased risk of LTFU in meta-analysis: male sex, older age, being single, unemployment, lower educational status, advanced WHO stage, low weight, worse functional status, poor adherence, nondisclosure, not receiving cotrimoxazole prophylactic therapy when indicated, receiving care at secondary level and more recent year of initiation. No association was seen for CD4 cell count, tuberculosis at baseline, regimen, and geographical setting. CONCLUSION: There are several sociodemographic, clinical, patient behaviour, treatment-related and system level risk factors for LTFU from ART programs. Knowledge of risk factors should be used to better target retention interventions and develop tools to identify high-risk patients.",,pubmed

HIV prevalence among Mozambican women aged 15-49 years is 15%, and vertical transmission rate is still high. The study investigated HIV exposure in children aged less than 2 years in Mozambique and the factors associated with unknown HIV exposure and with HIV exposure status in this population. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analytical study using data from the 2015 Survey of Indicators on Immunization, Malaria and HIV/AIDS in Mozambique. A total of 2141 mothers (15-49 years) with children aged less than 2 years were interviewed. The dependent variables were ""known HIV exposure status in a child"" and ""HIV-exposed child,"" and the explanatory variables were mother's social, demographic, economic, and reproductive health characteristics. We used binary and logistic regression, adjusted for complex sampling, to determine the association between variables. RESULTS: HIV exposure status was unknown in 27% of children (95% CI, 25.1-28.9). Mothers residing in the North (AOR, 4.41; 95% CI, 2.18-8.91), in rural area (AOR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.33-4.35), with no education (AOR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.38-5.36), and not having utilized any health services in the last pregnancy (AOR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.42-2.55) were more likely to have a child with unknown HIV exposure status. Six percent of children were HIV-exposed (95% CI, 5-7). Children were less likely to be HIV-exposed if the head of the household was a male (AOR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.08-0.86), if the mother was residing in the North (AOR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.26-0.66) and did not utilize any health services in her last pregnancy (AOR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.32-0.83). CONCLUSION: The high proportion of children with unknown HIV exposure status and the associated socioeconomic factors suggests that HIV retesting of eligible women throughout breastfeeding should be intensified and identifies the urgent need to reach women without prior access to health care using a multisectoral approach.",,pubmed

METHODOLOGY: This was an action research study with qualitative and quantitative design following a sequential approach implemented in a 4-phased manner. It was carried out in the 6 selected villages from July,2015 to June,2017. The screening for active TB among chest symptomatics is followed as per the guidelines of the (RNTCP) Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program in India. RESULTS: In all, 1455 households were surveyed in the 6 tribal dominated villages of 4 districts, namely Balangir, Dhenkanal, Kandhamal and Mayurbhanj. Total population of the villages was 6681. Based on the eligibility, 5144 (97.7%) individuals were screened. About 139 (2.3%) could not be screened due to non-availability in their households during day time. Out of the screened individuals (5144), 126 chest symptomatics were identified. Sputum samples were collected from them and sent to the National Reference Laboratory, RMRC, Bhubaneswar using public transport and maintaining cold chain. Out of 126 chest symptomatics, 35 patients were found to be having active TB disease and 18 were culture positive. The prevalence of pulmonary TB is 0.68%. The risk factors seemed to be ignorance about TB symptoms, addiction to alcoholic drinks, difficulty reaching the health facilities owing to the long distances, lack of communication and transport. In addition, other morbidities like Malaria, diabetes, hypertension, malnutrition, etc. were observed in the tribes of the study sites. CONCLUSION: TB control programs need further strengthening in the tribal dominated regions. This study is the first of its kind in this State.",,pubmed
A468,Understanding the role of disease knowledge and risk perception in shaping preventive behavior for selected vector-borne diseases in Guyana.,10.1371/journal.pntd.0008149,Aerts C; Revilla M; Duval L; Paaijmans K; Chandrabose J; Cox H; Sicuri E,2020.0,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"BACKGROUND: Individual behavior, particularly choices about prevention, plays a key role in infection transmission of vector-borne diseases (VBDs). Since the actual risk of infection is often uncertain, individual behavior is influenced by the perceived risk. A low risk perception is likely to diminish the use of preventive measures (behavior). If risk perception is a good indicator of the actual risk, then it has important implications in a context of disease elimination. However, more research is needed to improve our understanding of the role of human behavior in disease transmission. The objective of this study is to explore whether preventive behavior is responsive to risk perception, taking into account the links with disease knowledge and controlling for individuals' socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. More specifically, the study focuses on malaria, dengue fever, Zika and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), using primary data collected in Guyana-a key country for the control and/or elimination of VBDs, given its geographic location. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The data were collected between August and December 2017 in four regions of the country. Questions on disease knowledge, risk perception and self-reported use of preventive measures were asked to each participant for the four diseases. A structural equation model was estimated. It focused on data collected from private households only in order to control for individuals' socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, which led to a sample size of 497 participants. The findings showed evidence of a bidirectional association between risk perception and behavior. A one-unit increase in risk perception translated into a 0.53 unit increase in self-reported preventive behavior for all diseases, while a one-unit increase in self-reported preventive behavior (i.e. the use of an additional measure) led to a 0.46 unit decrease in risk perception for all diseases (except CL). This study also showed that higher education significantly improves knowledge and that better knowledge increases the take up of preventive measures for malaria and dengue, without affecting risk perception. CONCLUSIONS: In trying to reach elimination, it appears crucial to promote awareness of the risks and facilitate access to preventive measures, so that lower risk perception does not translate into lower preventive behavior.",,pubmed

The parasite used to show a well-defined geographical distribution; however, during the last decade the parasite has spread into new areas. This change in the worldwide distribution of the parasite and in leishmaniasis epidemiology is the result of man's ill-considered interventions in the environment and of the consequent global warming.Areas covered: The present review focuses on Leishmaniasis incidence in the Mediterranean basin and underlines the pressing need to raise awareness toward the real burden of the disease in the European region. The research was undertaken using Pubmed and including all studies up to January 2020.Expert opinion: Environmental and climatic transformations have allowed the shifting northward of sand fly European geographical distribution, affecting areas traditionally considered as Leishmania-free, including Northern Italy, Germany, and even Belgium. The large-scale migration from the Middle East and Africa to Europe, and particularly to Italy for its central position in the Mediterranean basin, represents an additional and critical risk factor for the spread not only of leishmaniasis but also of other potentially life-threatening diseases. These factors highlight how the current epidemiological European scenario could drastically evolve in the next future.",,pubmed

The country's pediatric case finding strategy uses global best practices of index testing, provider-initiated counselling and testing, and targeted community testing of at-risk populations to find about 50,000 children living with HIV (CLHIV) who are undiagnosed. However, context-specific strategies are necessary to find the hidden children to meet the full 90% target. This study assesses whether sex of the caregiver is associated with HIV status of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) as a valuable strategy for enhanced pediatric case findings. METHODS: Data originate from the community-based, United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Kizazi Kipya Project, which works towards increasing OVC's and their caregivers' uptake of HIV/AIDS and other health and social services in Tanzania. Included in this study are 39,578 OVC ages 0-19 years who the project enrolled during January through March 2017 in 18 regions of Tanzania and who voluntarily reported their HIV status. Data analysis involved multi-level logistic regression, with OVC HIV status as the outcome of interest and caregiver's sex as the main independent variable. RESULTS: Three-quarters (74.3%) of the OVC included in the study had female caregivers, and their overall HIV prevalence was 7.1%. The prevalence was significantly higher (p < 0.001) among OVC with male caregivers (7.8%) than among OVC with female caregivers (6.8%), and indeed, multivariate analysis showed that OVC with male caregivers were significantly 40% more likely to be HIV-positive than those with female caregivers (OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.08-1.83). This effect was the strongest among 0-4 year-olds (OR = 4.02, 95% CI 1.61-10.03), declined to 1.72 among 5-9 year-olds (OR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.02-2.93), and lost significance for children over age 9 years. Other significant factors included OVC age and nutritional status; caregiver HIV status and marital status; household health insurance status, and family size; and rural versus urban residence. CONCLUSIONS: OVC in Tanzania with male caregivers have a 40% higher likelihood of being HIV-positive than those with female caregivers. HIV risk assessment activities should target OVC with male caregivers, as well as OVC who have malnutrition, HIV-positive caregivers, or caregivers who do not disclose their HIV status to community volunteers. Further, younger HIV-positive OVC are more likely to live in rural areas, while older HIV-positive OVC are more likely to live in urban areas. These factors should be integrated in HIV risk assessment algorithms to enhance HIV testing yields and pediatric case-finding in the OVC population in Tanzania.",,pubmed

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study, spanning January 2000-December 2018, compared ALI (aminotransferase > 200 U/L, severe ALI, and hospitalization with ALI) in statin users and non-users among uninfected, hepatitis C virus (HCV) mono-infected, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV co-infected, and HIV mono-infected veterans within 18 months. We estimated adjusted Cox proportional hazards models comparing statin users and non-users and comparing statin intensity level with non-use; and estimate Cox proportional hazards models utilizing time-dependent coding of statin intensity. Adjusted models included restricted cubic splines of the propensity score as an adjustment variable. RESULTS: From a total of 166,439 patients who met the study criteria, statin initiators were older, had higher values of body mass index, higher values of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, and lower values of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. HCV mono-infected and HIV/HCV co-infected cohorts had the highest rates of ALI, and statin users had lower rates across all outcomes of ALI compared with non-users in unadjusted analysis. Statin use is associated with a lower risk of all ALI outcomes compared with non-users. Patients on a high intensity are not associated with a statistically significant increase in risk for any ALI outcome. For each additional 30 days of treatment, there was a reduced risk of any ALI outcome across all cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Statin initiators had a lower risk of any ALI outcome compared with non-users within 18 months regardless of HIV and/or HCV status.",,pubmed

We measured the association between socio-economic status and intermediate social determinants of health (SDHs, including drug misuse, tobacco smoking and alcohol), and TB, taking into account their clustering in individuals. We conducted a case-control study in 23-38 years old UK-born White adults with first tuberculosis episode, and randomly selected age and sex frequency-matched community controls. Data was collected on education, household overcrowding, tobacco smoking, alcohol and drugs use, and history of homelessness and prison. Analyses were done using logistic regression models, informed by a formal theoretical causal framework (Directed Acyclic Graph). 681 TB cases and 1183 controls were recruited. Tuberculosis odds were four times higher in subjects with education below GCSE O-levels, compared to higher education (OR = 3.94; 95%CI: 2.74, 5.67), after adjusting for other TB risk factors (age, sex, BCG-vaccination and stays >/=3 months in Africa/Asia). When simultaneously accounting for respective SDHs, higher tuberculosis risk was independently associated with tobacco smoking, drugs use (especially injectable drugs OR = 5.67; 95%CI: 2.68, 11.98), homelessness and area-level deprivation. Population Attributable Fraction estimates suggested that tobacco and class-A drug use were, respectively, responsible for 18% and 15% of TB cases in this group. Our findings suggest that socio-economic deprivation remains a driver of tuberculosis in England, including through drugs misuse, tobacco smoking, and homelessness. These findings further support the integration of health and social services in high-risk young adults to improve TB control efforts.",,pubmed

The great challenge is to find strategies to reduce the impact of inequality and discrimination and develop policies to protect individuals living with - or at risk of - infections. METHODS: During the period from January 1 to May 31, 2016, a cross-sectional study was conducted on which all patients (N = 806) seeking inpatient treatment were enrolled. A structured diagnostic interview and rapid tests were conducted initially, and diagnoses were confirmed by tests conducted at a venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL). RESULTS: HIV and syphilis rates were 5.86% and 21.9%, respectively. Women were nearly 2.5 times more likely to have syphilis. HIV infection was associated with unprotected sex (odds ratio [OR]: 3.27, p = 0.003, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.51-7.11), and suicidal ideation (OR: 6.63, p = 0.001, 95%CI: 3.37-14.0). Although only 1.86% reported injecting drugs at any point during their lifetimes, this variable was associated with both HIV and syphilis. Elevated rates of HIV and syphilis were observed in the context of this severe social vulnerability scenario.

OBJECTIVES: To perform a meta-analysis in effort to identify risk factors of TB infection among HCWs. METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted between February and July 2019. Papers were searched in Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of science and information of interest were extracted. The correlation and effect estimation were analyzed using random or fixed effect model. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies consisting of 2871 cases and 15,673 controls were included and six risk factors were available for meta-analysis. Cumulative calculation found that age, working duration, and types of job were significant risk factor of TB infection while gender, active TB contact, and types of workplace were not associated significantly with TB infection among HCWs. Our pooled data revealed that decreased risk of TB infection was observed in age less than 30 years (age < 30 years vs. age >/= 30 years) and working duration less than five years (working duration < 5 years vs. >/=5 years). Being more than 40 years, working more than 10 years, and being physicians increased the risk of TB infection significantly compared to age </=40 years, working duration </=10 years, and other job types, respectively.

This meta-analysis aimed to determine HIV and drug-related stigma and the association it has with risk-taking behaviors among PWID. We searched PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Cochrane electronic databases independently in March 2019. After reviewing for any study duplicates the full-text of selected articles were assessed for eligibility using Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes (PICO) criteria. We used fixed and random-effects meta-analysis models to estimate the pooled prevalence, pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals. After a detailed assessment, a total of 14 studies containing 13,689 participants met the eligibility criteria. Among the potential risk factors: employment status, depression and sharing injecting paraphernalia had a significant relationship with HIV and drug stigma among PWIDs respectively (OR = 0.78, 95%CI = 0.62-0.98), (OR = 1.84, 95%CI = 1.45-2.33) and (OR = 2.20, 95%CI = 1.84-1.63). Illicit drug use related stigma was found to be associated with several concurrent effects. The impact of stigma should be considered in the development of drug use prevention strategies. Perceived stigma is correlated with numerous negative consequences in other populations including people living with HIV/AIDS. These data suggest this could also be generalized to people who inject drugs because it seems that individuals with internalized stigma experience drug dependence, reduced comfort in seeking help from services and higher rates of depression.",,pubmed

We set out to investigate whether index TB case HIV status was linked to a higher probability of latent TB infection among household contacts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected prospectively from participants in the intervention arm of a household cluster-randomised trial in two South Africa provinces (Mangaung, Free State, and Capricorn, Limpopo). In intervention group households, TB contacts underwent HIV testing and tuberculin skin testing (TST). TST induration was estimated at two cut-offs (>/=5mm, >/=10mm). Multilevel Bayesian regression models estimated posterior distributions of the percentage of household contacts with TST induration >/=5mm and >/=10mm by age group, and compared the odds of latent TB infection by key risk factors including HIV status index case age and study province. RESULTS: A total of 2,985 household contacts of 924 index cases were assessed, with most 2,725 (91.3%) undergoing TST. HIV prevalence in household contacts was 14% and 10% in Mangaung and Capricorn respectively. Overall, 16.8% (458/2,725) had TST induration of >/=5mm and 13.1% (359/2,725) >/=10mm. In Mangaung, children aged 0-4 years had a high TST positivity prevalence compared to their peers in Capricorn (22.0% vs. 7.6%, and 20.5% vs. 2.3%, using TST thresholds of >/=5mm and >/=10mm respectively). Compared to contacts from Capricorn, household contacts living in Mangaung were more likely to have TST induration >/=5mm (odds ratio [OR]: 3.08, 95% credibility interval [CI]: 2.13-4.58) and >/=10mm (OR: 4.52, 95% CI: 3.03-6.97). There was a 90% and 92% posterior probability that the odds of TST induration >/=5mm (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.56-1.14) and >/=10mm (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.53-1.10) respectively were lower in household contacts of HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative index cases. CONCLUSIONS: High TST induration positivity, especially among young children and people living in Mangaung indicates considerable TB transmission despite high antiretroviral therapy coverage. Household contact of HIV-positive index TB cases were less likely to have evidence of latent TB infection than contacts of HIV-negative index cases.",,pubmed

However, retention of patients in these programs remains a challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding factors associated with loss to follow-up (LTFU) and mortality outcomes is therefore important to inform targeted program interventions. METHODS: A retrospective multi-cohort analysis of 23,890 adult patients on ART over 36 months of follow-up in Kenya was done. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to assess for factors associated with LTFU and mortality at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Majority, 67.7%, were female. At 36 months, 27.2% were LTFU and 13.5% had died. Factors associated with mortality at 36 months included older age (51 years and above) using 20-35 years as reference [(adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-1.86, p < 0.001], being male (aOR, 1.59, 95% CI 1.39-1.83, p < 0.001), divorced using married as reference (aOR, 1.86, 95% CI 1.56-2.22, p < 0.001), having a body mass index (BMI) score of less than 18.5 kg/m(2) using 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2) as reference (aOR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.52-2.11, p < 0.001), and, World Health Organization stage III and IV using stage I as the reference (aOR, 1.94, 95% CI 1.43-2.63 and aOR, 4.24, 95% CI 3.06-5.87, p < 0.001 respectively). Factors associated with LTFU at 36 months included being young between 20 and 35 years (aOR, 1.49, 95% CI 1.40-1.59, p < 0.001) using 36-50 years as reference, being male (aOR, 1.19, 95% CI 1.12-1.27, p < 0.001), and being single or divorced using married as reference (aOR, 1.34, 95% CI 1.23-1.45 and aOR, 1.25, 95% CI 1.15-1.36, p < 0.001 respectively). Patients with baseline BMI of less than 18.5 kg/m(2) using normal BMI as reference (aOR, 1.68, 95% CI 1.39-2.02, p < 0.001) were also likely to be LTFU. CONCLUSIONS: Factors associated with LTFU and mortality were generally similar over time. Implementation of programs in similar settings should be tailored to gender, age profiles, nutritional, and, marital status of patients to address LTFU. In addition, programs should focus on the care of older patients to reduce the risk of mortality.",,pubmed

METHODS: We enrolled newly diagnosed index patients and their household contacts from March 2014 to June 2016. All contacts were evaluated with a symptom questionnaire, tuberculin skin test (TST) and HIV test. Clinical evaluation and sputum testing were performed for those with symptoms, positive TST result or HIV infection. RESULTS: We enrolled 1155 contacts of 330 index patients with bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis and 192 contacts of 55 index patients with non-bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis. 3.5% of contacts of patients with bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis were diagnosed with tuberculosis, whereas no contacts of index patients with non-bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis were. Of those diagnosed with tuberculosis disease, 58.5% reported symptoms, 34.1% reported no symptoms but had positive TST results, and 7.3% had neither symptoms nor positive TST but were HIV-positive. Among 872 contacts with a TST result, 50.9% of contacts of index patients with bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis and 41.0% of contacts of index patients with non-bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis had a positive result (prevalence ratio = 1.16, 95% confidence interval 0.92-1.48). CONCLUSION: In a high-burden setting, tuberculosis disease was more prevalent among contacts of patients with bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis than contacts of patients with non-bacteriologically confirmed disease. TST was feasible to perform and helped to detect cases that would have been missed had only symptomatic contacts been evaluated.",,pubmed

Sociodemographic and risk heterogeneity across the treatment cascade has not yet been comprehensively described or quantified and we seek to systematically review and synthesize research on this topic among adults in Africa. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature in Embase and MEDLINE databases as well as grey literature sources published in English between 2014 and 2018. We included studies that included people living with HIV (PLHIV) aged >/=15 years, and reported a 90-90-90 outcome: awareness of HIV-positive status, ART use among those diagnosed or viral suppression among those on ART. We summarized measures of association between sociodemographics, within each outcome, and as a composite measure of population-wide viral suppression. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: From 3533 screened titles, we extracted data from 92 studies (50 peer-reviewed, 42 grey sources). Of included studies, 32 reported on awareness, 53 on ART use, 32 on viral suppression and 23 on population-wide viral suppression. The majority of studies were conducted in South Africa, Uganda, and Malawi and reported data for age and gender. When stratified, PLHIV ages 15 to 24 years had lower median achievement of the treatment cascade (60-49-81), as compared to PLHIV >/=25 years (70-63-91). Men also had lower median achievement of the treatment cascade (66-72-85), compared to women (79-76-89). For population-wide viral suppression, women aged >/=45 years had achieved the 73% target, while the lowest medians were among 15- to 24-year-old men (37%) and women (49%). CONCLUSIONS: Considerable heterogeneity exists by age and gender for achieving the HIV 90-90-90 treatment goals. These results may inform delivery of HIV testing and treatment in sub-Saharan Africa, as targeting youth and men could be a strategic way to maximize the population-level impact of ART.",,pubmed

We mapped and characterised these high-prevalence areas for young adults (15-29 years of age), as a proxy for areas with high levels of transmission, for 7 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa: Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used geolocated survey data from the most recent United States Agency for International Development (USAID) demographic and health surveys (DHSs) and AIDS indicator surveys (AISs) (collected between 2008-2009 and 2015-2016), which included about 113,000 adults-of which there were about 53,000 young adults (27,000 women, 28,000 men)-from over 3,500 sample locations. First, ordinary kriging was applied to predict HIV prevalence at unmeasured locations. Second, we explored to what extent behavioural, socioeconomic, and environmental factors explain HIV prevalence at the individual- and sample-location level, by developing a series of multilevel multivariable logistic regression models and geospatially visualising unexplained model heterogeneity. National-level HIV prevalence for young adults ranged from 2.2% in Tanzania to 7.7% in Mozambique. However, at the subnational level, we found areas with prevalence among young adults as high as 11% or 15% alternating with areas with prevalence between 0% and 2%, suggesting the existence of areas with high levels of transmission Overall, 15.6% of heterogeneity could be explained by an interplay of known behavioural, socioeconomic, and environmental factors. Maps of the interpolated random effect estimates show that environmental variables, representing indicators of economic activity, were most powerful in explaining high-prevalence areas. Main study limitations were the inability to infer causality due to the cross-sectional nature of the surveys and the likely under-sampling of key populations in the surveys. CONCLUSIONS: We found that, among young adults, micro-epidemics of relatively high HIV prevalence alternate with areas of very low prevalence, clearly illustrating the existence of areas with high levels of transmission. These areas are partially characterised by high economic activity, relatively high socioeconomic status, and risky sexual behaviour. Localised HIV prevention interventions specifically tailored to the populations at risk will be essential to curb transmission. More fine-scale geospatial mapping of key populations,-such as sex workers and migrant populations-could help us further understand the drivers of these areas with high levels of transmission and help us determine how they fuel the generalised epidemics in SSA.",,pubmed

We explored the risk factors for HIV infection among married couples in settings with differing HIV prevalence levels in Rakai, Uganda. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted among 664 heterosexual couples living in three HIV prevalence strata (low: 9-11.2%; medium: 11.4-20% or high HIV prevalence: 21-43%) in Rakai District, south-western Uganda, between November 2013 and February 2014. Data were collected on socio-demographic and behavioural characteristics from all consenting adults and aggregated to allow for couple-level analyses. We conducted bivariate and multivariable Logistic regression to assess the factors that were independently associated with HIV infection among married couples. Data were analysed using STATA statistical software (version 14.1). RESULTS: Of the 664 couples, 6.4% (n = 42) were in HIV-discordant relationships; 5.8% (n = 39) were in concordant HIV-positive relationships while 87.8% (n = 583) were in concordant HIV-negative relationships. At the bivariate analysis, we found that residing in a high HIV prevalence stratum, reporting extra-marital relations, age difference between partners and number of previous marriages were significantly associated with being part of an HIV infected couple. After adjusting for potential cofounders, living in a high HIV prevalence stratum (Adjusted OR [AOR] =2.31, 95% CI: 1.52, 3.52), being in a third or higher order relationship (AOR = 3.80, 95% CI: 2.30, 6.28), and engagement in extra-marital relations (AOR = 1.75; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.59) were associated with couple HIV infection. Individuals that had stayed together for six or more years had 28% odds of being part of an HIV infected couple (AOR = 0.28; 95%CI: 0.18, 0.43). CONCLUSION: Living in a high HIV prevalence stratum, engagement in extra-marital relations and having a higher number of previous marriages were significant risk factors for HIV infection among married couples. Long marital duration was associated with reduced risk of HIV infection. Interventions that increase marital stability and those that promote pre-marital couples' HIV testing before marital formation can reduce HIV transmission risk among married couples in this setting.",,pubmed

Biomarkers and drug resistance patterns in these discordant patients in comparison to the concordant treatment failure group need to be studied to understand possible risk factors associated with this condition. HIV infected patients on anti-retroviral therapy for one year were enrolled under three categories namely VNRs (n = 25), treatment failures (n = 18) and treatment responders (n = 40). They were assessed for HIV drug resistance by sequencing, plasma cytokines by luminex assay, T cell activation status by flow cytometry and total IgE levels by ELISA. VNR and failure patients had significantly lower median baseline CD4 counts than the responders. VNRs had significantly higher CD4 counts but lower viral load than treatment failures at one year of ART. VNRs had the highest eosinophil counts and the highest IL-5 levels among all the groups. IL-5 levels in them correlated with their viral load values. Frequency of Treg cells was also highest among the VNR group participants. More than 60% of the viremic patients irrespective of their groups harboured multiple HIV drug resistance mutations and mutation pattern did not differ between the groups. Low baseline CD4 counts and presence of multiple drug resistance mutations in the viremic groups highlighted the importance of early ART initiation and viral load monitoring irrespective of presence of immunologic failure. High IL-5 levels in VNR group indicated a need for investigating causal relationship between IL-5 and viral replication to devise therapeutic strategies to control viremia.",,pubmed
A483,Length of maternal schooling and children's risk of malaria infection: evidence from a natural experiment in Uganda.,10.1136/bmjgh-2019-001729,Masuda K,2020.0,BMJ global health,"INTRODUCTION: An estimated 216 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide every year. Cross-sectional studies have reported negative association between maternal education and child malaria risks; however, no randomised trial or quasi-experimental study using a natural experiment has confirmed a causal relationship between these two factors. I used the free primary education reform in Uganda to assess the causal effects of maternal schooling on children's risk of malaria infection. METHODS: Malaria biomarkers of children aged <5 years were collected from the 2009 and 2014 Uganda Malaria Indicator Surveys (n=5316). In 1997, the government eliminated tuition requirements in primary schools, which increased the educational attainment of the affected cohorts. Using exposure to the reform as an instrumental variable, I used a two-stage least squares approach to estimate the causal effects of maternal year of education on the probability that a child would contract malaria at the time of the survey. I also evaluated the cost-effectiveness of primary schooling as a malaria control intervention. RESULTS: One extra year of maternal education reduced children's risk of malaria infection by 7.5 percentage points (p=0.057) from baseline (34.9%). The length of maternal education was also positively associated with insecticide-treated bednet usage by their children. The results were robust to a variety of sensitivity tests. Primary schooling for women was a cost-effective intervention to reduce children's malaria infection. CONCLUSION: Improving access to primary education could be a cost-effective measure to reduce malaria prevalence among children of educated mothers aged <5 years in malaria-endemic countries.",,pubmed

OBJECTIVE: To analyze factors associated with treatment and control of trachoma treatment in schoolchildren diagnosed during the national campaign in 2014, in the town of Russas, Ceara. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was brought out from January to April 2016. Social, demographic, economic and follow-up data were collected for 390 schoolchildren aged five to 14 years old, diagnosed with trachoma in the campaign in 2014. They were defined dependent variables: trachoma treatment and control of trachoma disease, categorized as adequate and inadequate, and multivariate analyzes were performed. RESULTS: Treatment was considered adequate in 56.7% of schoolchildren and in only 5.9% treatment control was classified as adequate. In the multivariate analysis, they have got an association with the trachoma treatment result: rural residence zone and waste destination in a non-public space. The last control of the treatment of trachoma remained associated to the variables: rural residence zone; family income less than a minimum wage and school not examined by the physician. CONCLUSION: Inadequate treatment and control of trachoma treatment showed an association with socioeconomic variables and follow-up of primary care. Health education activities were not accessible to the entire community, indicating the need for more involvement by primary care professionals.",,pubmed

Brazil is the only country that has not yet reached the goal of eliminating the disease as a public health problem. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze social deprivation in the municipalities of Bahia and its relation with the detection of new cases of leprosy in the population. METHODS: It is an ecological study conducted in the state of Bahia, from 2001 to 2015. Variables analyzed: detection rate of new cases, social deprivation index (SDI) and Hansen's disease in children under 15 years of age. The SDI was built on four variables: socioeconomic performance index, per capita income, proportion of extremely poor, and household density. For spatial analysis, local empirical bayesian modeling and global and local Moran statistics were used. Statistical analysis used multivariate, spatial and logistic regression, odds ratio calculation and analysis of variance. RESULTS: Leprosy showed heterogeneous distribution in the state, with concentration in the north-west and south axis. 60.4% (n = 252) of the municipalities presented very low life conditions. An association was observed between living conditions and the detection of leprosy, with higher coefficients in the municipality group with better living conditions (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: It was concluded that the worst conditions acted as an impediment to the diagnosis, while increasing the risk of illness. Good conditions have the opposite effect.",,pubmed

Herein we analyse the prevalence of PDR and risk of virological failure (VF) over time among migrants to Italy enrolled in ARCA. METHODS: HIV-1 sequences from ART-naive patients of non-Italian nationality were retrieved from ARCA database from 1998 to 2017. PDR was defined by at least one mutation from the reference 2009 WHO surveillance list. RESULTS: Protease/reverse transcriptase sequences from 1,155 patients, mainly migrants from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA; 42%), followed by Latin America (LA; 25%) and Western countries (WE; 21%), were included. PDR was detected in 8.6% of sequences (13.1% versus 5.8% for B and non-B strains, respectively; P<0.001). 2.1% of patients carried a PDR for protease inhibitors (PIs; 2.1% versus 2.3%; P=0.893), 3.9% for nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs; 6.8% versus 2.1%; P<0.001) and 4.3% for non-nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs; 6.3% versus 3.1%; P=0.013). Overall, prevalence of PDR over the years remained stable, while it decreased for PIs in LA (P=0.021) and for NRTIs (P=0.020) among migrants from WE. Having more than one class of PDR (P=0.015 versus absence of PDR), higher viral load at diagnosis (P=0.008) and being migrants from SSA (P=0.001 versus WE) were predictive of VF, while a recent calendar year of diagnosis (P<0.001) was protective for VF. CONCLUSIONS: PDR appeared to be stable over the years in migrants to Italy enrolled in ARCA; however, it still remains an important cause of VF together with viral load at diagnosis.",,pubmed

These stressors have been linked to depression, which can lead to lower HIV treatment adherence. This study seeks to determine how social and economic equity, family cohesion, and social supports may be related to depression among adolescents living with HIV. We used baseline data from the Suubi + Adherence study, a 5-year longitudinal randomized controlled trial among adolescents living with HIV in southwestern Uganda (n = 675; ages 10-16 years). Hierarchical logistic regression models were conducted separately among in-school adolescents and out-of-school adolescents to assess the hypothesized associations between economic and social equity, social support, and depression. About half of the participants meet the criteria for depression. Adolescents with depression were found to have fewer economic and social supports. Our findings indicate that social and economic equity [odds ratio (OR) = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74, 0.99], family cohesion (OR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.91-0.96), and social support from friends (OR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.91-0.998) are associated with depression for in-school HIV infected adolescents and could be protective factors. The results of this study suggest that social and economic equity may play a protective role against depression and other poor mental health outcomes. Potential interventions for adolescents living with HIV should consider these social and familial factors as they may be protective of depression in this population.",,pubmed

Informed by the ecological model, this study explored multilevel factors associated with perpetration of IPV among men who have sex with men. The participants were recruited from 15 cities in mainland China. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses showed that the prevalence of committing physical, sexual, monitoring, controlling and emotional IPV was 8.6%, 7.1%, 15.2%, 7.6% and 17.1%, respectively. Committing physical IPV showed a positive association with perceived public discrimination and self-stigma towards homosexuality. Committing sexual IPV showed a positive association with involvement with a homosexual support agency and more sex partners. Monitoring IPV was positively associated with higher education and perceived stress, but negatively associated with instrumental and emotional support. Committing controlling IPV showed a positive association with drug use during sex and self-stigma but a negative association with self-esteem, self-efficacy and older age at first homosexual sex. Committing emotional IPV showed a positive association with commercial sex behaviour and perceived stress, but a negative association with resilience. Committing IPV was prevalent in this population. It is necessary to distinguish the various types of IPV in future studies, given their differences in associated factors.",,pubmed

It is mostly prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical areas among communities with limited access to clean water and adequate sanitation. This study was conducted in uMkhanyakude District in rural South Africa, where water resources are limited. In this community, individuals frequently come into contact with freshwater bodies for various reasons. The objective of the study was to identify critical contextual and psychosocial factors for behaviour change to reduce risk of schistosomiasis transmission in Madeya Village, uMkhanyakude district. Methods: Structured household interviews were held with 57 primary caregivers to assess their thoughts and attitudes towards collecting water from a safe source. We used the Risk, Attitude, Norm, Ability, and Self-regulation model (RANAS) to estimate the intervention potential for each factor by analysing differences in means between groups of current performers and nonperformers who use safe water sources. Results: The subscale vulnerability belonging to the risk factor on the RANAS was scored as low. Furthermore, attitudinal factors towards the use of safe water sources were found to be low. Ability factors (confidence in performance and confidence in recovery) towards the use of safe water sources were low as well, indicating that these factors should be the target of the intervention in the study area. Discussion: Based on this study, it is recommended that a community-based empowerment intervention strategy it appropriate. The strategy should prompt behavioural practice and public commitment, use persuasive language to boost self-efficacy and target younger low-income caregivers between 18 and 35 years of age.",,pubmed

Child contacts exposed to Beijing strains were more likely than child contacts exposed to non-Beijing strains to be infected at baseline, by 12 months of follow-up, and during follow-up. We noted an increased but nonsignificant tendency for child contacts to develop TB. Beijing strains were not associated with TB in adult contacts. These findings suggest that Beijing strains are more transmissible in children than are non-Beijing strains.",,pubmed

We first evaluated the predictive performance of six published signatures on the transcriptional dataset obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from HHC that either progressed to TB disease or not (non-progressors) during a five-year follow-up. The area under the curve (AUC) values for the six signatures ranged from 0.670 to 0.461, and the PPVs did not reach the WHO published target product profiles (TPPs). We therefore used as training cohort the earliest time-point samples from the African cohort of adolescents (GSE79362) and applied an ensemble feature selection pipeline to derive a novel 29-gene signature (PREDICT29). PREDICT29 was tested on 16 progressors and 21 non-progressors. PREDICT29 performed better in segregating progressors from non-progressors in the Brazil cohort with the area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.911 and PPV of 20%. This proof of concept study demonstrates that PREDICT29 can predict risk of progression/reactivation to clinical TB disease in recently exposed individuals at least 5 years prior to disease development. Upon validation in larger and geographically diverse cohorts, PREDICT29 can be used to risk-stratify recently infected for targeted therapy.",,pubmed

From this perspective, the diseases associated with AIDS are not a main threat for patients who use Antiretroviral Therapy (ART). A new set of HIV associated complications have emerged resulting in comorbidities related to aging and ART exposure as cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study aimed to evaluate the cardiovascular risk factors in people living with HIV (PLWH) in Brazil. METHODOLOGY: This was a cross-sectional study carried out at all Specialized Care Services for people living with HIV in the Southeast of Brazil. A sociodemographic and clinical questionnaire was used and cardiovascular risk assessed through the Framingham Score. Data analysis was performed by Chi-square, Fisher's exact test and logistic regression. RESULTS: The majority were male, over 40 years old and they showed a mean age of 44 years. Current hypertension, diabetes, altered body mass index, presence of metabolic syndrome and altered abdominal circumference were also associated with cardiovascular risk. After regression analysis, male sex, older age, smoking, diabetes, hypertension and metabolic syndrome were related as predictive factors for a higher cardiovascular risk. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that combination of the prevention of modifiable risk factors with considerable changes in lifestyle are determining factors for success in the therapeutic of PLWH. High levels of motivation are essential for behavioral changes, and nurses are ideally position to provide safe care with nonpharmacological strategies for CVD risk reduction.",,pubmed

The geographic distribution of DR-TB in Fortaleza, Brazil, was also determined. From March 2017 to February 2018, 41 DR-TB isolates and 69 drug-susceptible pulmonary TB isolates were obtained from patients seen at a referral hospital in Fortaleza, Brazil. Samples were subjected to phenotypic and genetic analysis of resistance; the spatial distribution of the participants was also analyzed. Primary resistance was high (50.9%) among participants. The following risk factors for DR were identified: being female ( p = 0.03), having diabetes ( p < 0.01), history of previous TB disease ( p < 0.01), and the number of intra-domiciliary contacts ( p < 0.01). Analysis by multiplex allele-specific polymerase chain reaction detected mutations in the genes katG (65.8%) , rpoB (43.9%), inhA promoter (14.6%), and gyrA (9.8%). Sequencing identified mutations in the the genes katG (75.6%), inhA promoter (19.5%), rpoB (85.4%), and gyrA (100%). There was no mutation in the rrs gene.

We aimed to explore associations between community TB transmission and socio-economic factors within a high TB-HIV burdened setting. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional molecular epidemiology study among adult patients attending a routine TB clinic. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from TB registers and clinical folders; social and economic data were collected using interviewer-administered questionnaires; Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were genotyped and classified as clustered/non-clustered using IS6110-based Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism. Composite ""social"" and ""economic"" scores were generated from social and economic data. Data were analyzed using StataCorp version 15.0 software. Stratified, bivariable analyses were performed using chi-squared. Wilcoxon signed rank tests; univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were developed to explore associations in the social, economic, traditional and composite TB risk factors with TB transmission. RESULTS: Of the 505 patient Mtb  strains, 348(69%) cases were classified as clustered and 157(31%) were non-clustered. Clustered cases were more likely to have lived longer in the study community, (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, 95% Confidence interval [C.I]:1.02-1.09, p = 0.006); in the same house (OR = 1.04, C.I: 0.99-1.08, p = 0.06); and had increased household crowding conditions (i.e fewer rooms used for sleeping, OR = 0.45, C.I:0.21-0.95, p = 0.04). Although a higher proportion of clustered cases had a low economic score, no statistically significant association was found between clustering and either the economic score (p = 0.13) or social score (p = 0.26). CONCLUSIONS: We report a novel association between Mtb transmission and prolonged stay within a high burdened community. Transmission was also associated with fewer rooms for sleeping in a household. Increased social interaction and prolonged residence in a high burdened community are important factors linked to Mtb transmission, possibly due to increased probability of higher effective contact rates. The possible importance of degrees of poverty within low socio-economic setting warrants further study.",,pubmed

The purpose of this study was to develop a risk prediction tool to identify PLHIV at risk of non-retention in care over the course of the next year. METHOD: We used stepwise logistic regression to assess sociodemographic, clinical and behavioral predictors of non-retention in HIV care. Retention in care was defined as having evidence of at least two encounters with an HIV care provider (or CD4 or viral load lab tests as a proxy measure for the encounter), at least 3 months apart within a year. We validated the risk prediction tool internally using the bootstrap method. RESULTS: The risk prediction tool included a total of six factors: age group, race, poverty level, homelessness, problematic alcohol/drug use and viral suppression status. The total risk score ranged from 0 to 17. Compared to those in the lowest quartile (0 risk score), those who were in the middle two quartiles (score 1-4) and those in the upper quartile (>4 risk score) were more likely not to be retained in care (odds ratio [OR] 1.63 [CI; 1.39-1.92] and OR 4.82 [CI; 4.04-5.78] respectively). The discrimination ability for the prediction model was 0.651. CONCLUSION: We found that increased risk for non-retention in care can be predicted with routinely available variables. Since the discrimination of the tool was low, future studies may need to include more prognostic factors in the risk prediction tool.",,pubmed

As a consequence, healthcare professionals caring for PLHIV in high-income countries have increasingly focused on issues beyond those related to HIV itself, i.e. HIV-related neurological disease, or associated opportunistic infections, which include co-infections, and primarily age- and lifestyle-related comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, osteoporosis and frailty. This review considers drug side effects and comorbidities seen in PLHIV and evaluates the role of a recently licensed STR - bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF) - in mitigating some of those challenges. Factors that need to be evaluated for initial cART regimens include: pretreatment CD4 cell count; plasma HIV RNA; HIV drug resistance; hepatitis B co-infection; HLA-B*5701 status; drug-drug interactions; pregnancy and pregnancy potential; psychiatric and physical comorbidities such as renal or bone disease, as well as simplicity and adherence-friendliness, all of which need to be considered in all lines of therapy. BIC/FTC/TAF constitutes a new STR that includes an unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor with a high barrier against resistance with TAF and FTC. Its virological efficacy was non-inferior to dolutegravir-based regimens previously recommended by most guidelines for treatment initiation in large double-blind, randomised clinical trials in treatment-naive or switch patients over 96 weeks. Tolerability and pharmacological properties of the regimen make it a useful tool to address several of the clinical management issues raised above.",,pubmed

Regarded as indicative of a high risk of TB progression, considerable efforts have been made to identify these cases through exploration of biomarkers. The present study aimed to evaluate simple scoring systems for TB exposure as screening tools for subclinical TB, the only identifiable of the incipient and subclinical disease states, in a contact investigation (CI) setting of low HIV-prevalence. METHODS: Nested within a large prospective study in household contacts (HHCs) of smear positive pulmonary TB cases in South-India conducted 2010-2012, we assessed 1) the association between the Tuberculosis Contact Score (TCS) and the Infectivity Score, with established tools for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, corrected for established TB risk factors, and 2) the capability of the TB exposure scores to identify subclinical TB defined by Mtb-culture positivity in sputum or gastric aspirate (subjects < 5 years) specimen. RESULTS: Of 525 HHCs, 29 were Mtb-culture positive and 96.6% of these asymptomatic. The TCS and the Infectivity Score associated with positive Tuberculin Skin Test and QuantiFeron TB-Gold In-tube assay (QFT) results in multivariate analyses (TCS: OR(TST) 1.16, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.33; OR(QFT) 1.33 95% CI: 1.16, 1.51. Infectivity Score: OR(TST) 1.39, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.76; OR(QFT) 1.41 95% CI: 1.16, 1.71). The Infectivity Score showed a moderate capability to identify subclinical TB (AUC of 0.61, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.70). CONCLUSIONS: Although our results did not identify an easily applicable screening tool for subclinical TB, the present study indicates that focusing on TB-related symptoms in CI settings may be of limited value for early identification of HHCs with high risk for TB progression.",,pubmed

To promote this strategy, it is important to know which antecedents to behavioral change are the best to emphasize when promoting prevention. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine predictors for intention to prevent home infestation based on the Health Belief Model (HBM), a commonly used health intervention planning theory. MATERIALS & METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 112 heads of household in six communities with endemic and high rates of triatomine infestation in Loja province, Ecuador. The data was collected by a questionnaire including perceived severity, susceptibility, benefits to action, barriers to action, and self-efficacy. These data were also used to predict actual infestation of homes. RESULTS: Community members reported strong intentions to prevent home infestation. HBM constructs predicted about 14% of the observed variance in intentions. Perceived susceptibility and severity did not predict behavioral intention well; perceived barriers to small-scale action that reduce likelihood of infestation and self-efficacy in participating in surveillance systems did. Self-efficacy and perception of barriers were equally powerful predictors. The HBM constructs, however, did not predict well actual infestation. CONCLUSION: The findings supported the HBM as a way to predict intentions to prevent infestation of the home by triatomine bugs. The findings highlight that messages emphasizing self-efficacy in participating in surveillance systems and overcoming barriers to small-scale action that reduce likelihood of infestation, rather than a focus on risk, should be central messages when designing and implementing educational interventions for CD. The gap between behavioral intention and actual infestation reveals the need to assess home practices and their actual efficacy to fully enact and apply the HBM.",,pubmed

To understand the driving factors behind the epidemiological situation, we conducted a quantitative cross-sectional survey on knowledge, attitudes, behavior, and practices regarding HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among misSA living in six German cities utilizing participatory health research. METHODS: Participants were recruited by peer researchers. Levels of knowledge, information needs, and preferred methods of information dissemination were analyzed to inform future prevention planning. Additionally, we analyzed sexual behavior and other risk factors for contracting HIV and STIs. The results may facilitate the formulation of targeted prevention messages in the future. RESULTS: We included 2,432 participants in the analysis. General knowledge about HIV was adequate, as 86.9% were aware of the presented information. Statements about HIV co-infections were prior knowledge for 53.4% of the participants and about German HIV policies and HIV testing for 54.7%. Knowledge about other STIs differed, ranging from 69.6% who have ever heard of gonorrhea to 23.8% who have ever heard of genital warts. Groups with particular knowledge gaps were i) younger misSA, ii) recent migrants, iii) misSA without regular access to the German health care system, iv) misSA of lower socioeconomic status, and v) misSA with Muslim religious affiliation. The majority of participants reported information needs (72.8%), and 71.3% wanted to obtain this information from health professionals. Male misSA were more likely to report five or more sexual partners compared to females. Less than half of participants reported always using condoms with non-steady sexual partners (46.8%). Reasons for not using condoms differed between males and females. A considerable proportion of females (16.3%) and males (6.8%) experienced sexualized violence. More than one fourth of women (26.9%) were affected by female genital mutilation/cutting. DISCUSSION: Future prevention planning should focus on sub-groups with particular knowledge gaps, recognizing their preferred methods of information dissemination. Prevention messages for male misSA should focus on their own risk perception and for female misSA on empowerment, e.g. to negotiate condom use.",,pubmed

Malaria also places a substantial financial burden on families and Ethiopia's national economy. Economic evaluations, with evidence on equity and financial risk protection (FRP), are therefore essential to support decision-making for policymakers to identify best buys amongst possible malaria interventions. The aim of this study is to estimate the expected health and FRP benefits of universal public financing of key malaria interventions in Ethiopia. METHODS: Using extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA), the potential health and FRP benefits were estimated, and their distributions across socio-economic groups, of publicly financing a 10% coverage increase in artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLIN), indoor residual spraying (IRS), and malaria vaccine (hypothetical). RESULTS: ACT, LLIN, IRS, and vaccine would avert 358, 188, 107 and 38 deaths, respectively, each year at a net government cost of $5.7, 16.5, 32.6, and 5.1 million, respectively. The annual cost of implementing IRS would be two times higher than that of the LLIN interventions, and would be the main driver of the total costs. The averted deaths would be mainly concentrated in the poorest two income quintiles. The four interventions would eliminate about $4,627,800 of private health expenditures, and the poorest income quintiles would see the greatest FRP benefits. ACT and LLINs would have the largest impact on malaria-related deaths averted and FRP benefits. CONCLUSIONS: ACT, LLIN, IRS, and vaccine interventions would bring large health and financial benefits to the poorest households in Ethiopia.",,pubmed

Data on population sizes of PWID living with HIV are needed to inform the implementation of prevention, treatment and care programs. We estimated national population sizes of people who recently (past 12 months) injected drugs living with HIV and evaluated ecological associations with HIV prevalence in PWID. METHODS: We used national data on the prevalence of injecting drug use and of HIV among PWID, derived from systematic reviews, to estimate national population sizes of PWID living with HIV. Uncertainty was estimated using Monte Carlo simulation with 100,000 draws. We extracted data on sample characteristics from studies of HIV prevalence among PWID, and identified national indicators that have been observed or hypothesised to be associated with HIV prevalence in PWID. We used linear regression to evaluate associations between these variables and HIV prevalence in PWID. RESULTS: Four countries comprised 55% of the estimated global population of PWID living with HIV: Russia (572,500; 95% uncertainty interval (UI) 235,500-1,036,500); Brazil (462,000; 95% UI 283,500-674,500); China (316,500; 95% UI 171,500-493,500), and the United States (195,500; 95% UI 80,000-343,000). Greater anti-HCV prevalence and national income inequality were associated with greater HIV prevalence in PWID. CONCLUSION: The countries with the largest populations of PWID living with HIV will need to dramatically scale up prevention, treatment and care interventions to prevent further increases in population size. The association between anti-HCV prevalence and HIV prevalence among PWID corroborates findings that settings with increasing HCV should implement effective interventions to prevent HIV outbreaks. The association between income inequality and HIV among PWID reinforces the need to implement structural interventions alongside targeted individual-level strategies.",,pubmed

METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Global Health databases for studies published up to April 2019. Studies were included if they assessed reasons for adherence among people travelling from a country where malaria was not endemic to a country where it was. RESULTS: Thirty-two studies were included. Predictors of adherence were categorized as relating to either the nature of the travel or the traveller themselves. The three main predictors associated with nature of travel included: destination (e.g. country visited, urban vs rural areas), length of travel and type of travel (e.g. package vs backpacking holiday). The four main traveller-associated predictors were: age, reason for travel (e.g. business, leisure or visiting friends and relatives), perceived risk of catching malaria and experienced or expected medication effects. CONCLUSIONS: In order to improve adherence, clinicians should focus on travellers who are least likely to exhibit adherent behaviour. This includes travellers visiting destinations known to have lower adherence figures (such as rural areas), backpackers, business travellers, younger travellers and those travelling for longer periods of time. They should also check to ensure travellers' perceptions of the risks of malaria are realistic. Where appropriate, misperceptions (such as believing that curing malaria is easier than taking prophylaxis or that travellers visiting relatives have some level of innate immunity) should be corrected. All travellers should be informed of the potential side-effects of medication and given guidance on why it is nonetheless beneficial to continue to take prophylaxis. Further research is required to test interventions to improve adherence.",,pubmed

Uptake of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been slow among Black people, particularly in the South. We know little about how area-level HIV risk influences one's willingness to use PrEP. METHODS: 169 Black participants across 142 ZIP codes in the South completed the 2016 National Survey on HIV in the Black Community. We performed log-binomial regression to estimate the prevalence risk associated with residing in the upper 25th percentile of increases in new HIV diagnosis (2014-2015) within ZIP code and an individual's willingness to use PrEP, adjusting for individual and area-level covariates. RESULTS: Participants were 68% female, mean age of 36 years, and 24% willing to use PrEP. Among the ZIP codes, 23% were within Atlanta, GA. The median increase in new HIV diagnoses was 25 per 100,000 population from 2014 to 2015 (IQR, 14-49). Participants living in ZIP codes within the upper 25th (compared-to-lower 75th) percentile of new HIV diagnoses were more willing to use PrEP (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.06-3.86, P = .03).

The search terms were ""leishmaniasis"" AND ""risk factors"" using Google Scholar, PudMed, and Scielo. We reviewed 177 articles, 95 studies for VL, 75 for CL, and 7 on both forms. We identified 14 categories of risk factors which were divided into three groups: socioeconomic (7), environmental (5), and climate (2) variables. Socioeconomic factors were also associated with disease incidence in vulnerable human populations of arid and tropical developing regions. Environmental and climate factors showed significant associations with the incidence of VL and CL in all the studies that considered them. Proximity to natural vegetation remnants increased disease risk in both the New and Old World while the climate conditions favorable for disease transmission differed among regions. We propose a common conceptual framework for both clinical forms that highlights networks of interaction among risk factors. In both clinical forms, the interplay of these factors played a major role in disease incidence. Although there are similarities in environmental and socioeconomic conditions that mediate the transmission cycle of tropical, arid, and Mediterranean regions, the behavior of vector and reservoirs in each region is different. Special attention should be given to the possibility of vector adaptation to urban environments in developing countries where populations with low socioeconomic status are particularly vulnerable to the disease.",,pubmed

Pregnant women were randomized to the intervention (n = 64) or standard care (n = 63) along with male partners. Of 96 couples, 82 (85.0%) were followed to 3 months postpartum, when 31.0% of couples reported perfect adherence to HIV prevention. In logistic regression, intervention condition couples had three-fold higher odds of perfect adherence (AOR = 3.07, 95% CI = 1.01-9.32). A structural equation model found the intervention had moderate effects on couple communication, large effects on couple efficacy to take action around HIV, which in turn improved HIV prevention behaviors (CFI = 0.969; TLI = 0.955; RMSEA = 0.049). Strengthening couple communication and efficacy may help prevent the spread of HIV to infants or partners around the time of pregnancy.",,pubmed

Studies have shown that substitution therapies are best suited to treat opioid use disorder and reduce the risk of HIV and hepatitis C transmission and overdose. However, huge health inequalities exist in and outside of prison due to the different implementation of opioid substitution therapy (OST). People living in prisons are entitled to the best possible health care. This is established by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and by the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Solely the imprisonment, and not the loss of fundamental human rights, constitutes the punishment. METHODS: A qualitative literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar was performed in order to identify relevant publications. RESULTS: This review shows the inequality in availability of opioid substitution therapy for people living in prison compared with people outside of prison in Germany. It also gives possible reasons and evidence for this inequality, showing that continuing or initiating OST in prison is more beneficial for the health of people living in prison than abstinence-oriented treatment only. CONCLUSION: It is important that drug use disorder is treated as a serious illness also in prison. Joint efforts are needed to provide people living in prison with the best possible treatment and to minimize the adverse effects of drug use. Therefore, with laws, policies, and programs that conform to international human rights standards, each state must ensure that people living in prison receive the same health care as people outside of prison.",,pubmed

AIM: To evaluate recent epidemiological trends, geographic extension and potential factors associated with TB reemergence in Chile. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data analysis from official sources and trend analysis. RESULTS: TB incidence rate increased from 12.3 (2014) to 14.7 (2017) per 100,000 inhabitants. Morbidity rates also increased in nine out of 15 regions. The proportion of TB cases in specific groups has also increased in the last six years: HIV/AIDS (68%), immigrants (118%), drug users/alcoholics (267%) and homeless people (370%). Several indicators of the national TB program performance have deteriorated including TB case detection, HIV co-infection study and contact tracing activities. Overall results indicate a higher than expected case-fatality ratio (> 3%), high rates of loss from follow-up (> 5%), and low percentage of cohort healing rate (< 90%). This decline is associated with a Control Program with scarce human resources whose central budget decreased by 90% from 2008 to 2014. New molecular diagnostic tools and liquid media culture were only recently implemented. CONCLUSIONS: TB trends and overall program performance indicators have deteriorated in recent years in Chile and several factors appear to be involved. Multiple strategies will be required to rectify this situation.",,pubmed

Cutaneous leishmaniasis occurred predominantly in rural areas, with clusters in forest reserve regions or modified forest areas. Conversely, visceral leishmaniasis mainly occurred in peripheral and central urban areas associated with poorer environments and urban infrastructure, including worse sanitation. We conclude that the spatial distribution of leishmaniasis is closely related to the living environment of the risk population. The analyzed articles associated geospatial data with some risk factors for the disease, pointing out the locations where most cases occur, creating a relevant source to define control strategies.",,pubmed

AIM: To map R0 aiming to estimate the epidemiological risk of Chagas disease in Chile, its distribution and possible changes due to the global climate change. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used a relationship between R0 and entomological parameters of vectors as function of environmental variables, to map the risk of Chagas disease in Chile, under current and projected future environmental conditions. RESULTS: We obtained a geographical R0 estimation of Chagas disease in Chile. The highest R0averages correspond to the Central-Northern regions of Chile. T. cruzi transmission area could increase in the future due to climate changes. Independent of the future condition, both for optimistic and pessimistic climate change scenarios, the area of potential risk for Chagas disease transmission would increase. The estimated R0 values suggest that, if a control of T. infestans is not maintained, Chagas disease endemic status will persist or increase, independently of the climate change scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Mapping R0 values is an effective method to assess the risk of Chagas disease. The eventual increase in the transmission area of the disease is worrisome.",,pubmed
A512,"The risk of active tuberculosis among individuals living in tuberculosis-affected households in the Republic of Korea, 2015.",10.1371/journal.pone.0225744,Yang J; Lee S; Oh S; Han S; Park SY; Kim Y; Kim J; Park MS,2019.0,PloS one,"BACKGROUND: In the Republic of Korea (ROK), compared to other high-income countries, tuberculosis (TB) prevalence is relatively high. Active TB and latent TB infection (LTBI) surveillance of individuals living in TB-affected households has been conducted for several years. Although active case finding is an important strategy in low-prevalence, high-income countries, its effectiveness in a high prevalence setting is unclear. This study evaluated the risk of TB in household contact by calculating the incidence of TB among household contacts and comparing it with the general population of the ROK. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study, including 36,133 household-contacts of 17,958 TB patients reported in 2015, was conducted. The data was extracted from the Korean National TB Surveillance System (web-based TB cases notification system, KNTSS). The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to evaluate risk factors for incidence of TB. A P-value < .05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In this study, 319 (0.9%) of 36,133 household-contacts were reported as having TB within 1 year, which is a higher rate than the rate for the general population in the ROK. The rate of TB reported for contacts that had completed LTBI treatment (0.6%) was lower than for the LTBI group without treatment (4.6%). In multivariate analysis, age older than 65 (p < .001), being a spouse of a TB patient (p = .007), and LTBI without treatment (p = .013) were each a risk factor for TB incidence among contacts. Younger age (p < .001), presence of a cough (p < .001), testing positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB; p < .001), and cavity on radiograph (p < .001) of the index patient were also statistically significant risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals living in TB-affected households are at high risk of developing TB in the ROK and active case finding among them is a strategy effective in the early detection and prevention of TB.",,pubmed

We analyzed the geographic distribution of tuberculosis (TB) incidence in Michigan, USA to better understand the complex interplay between race and place, comparing patterns in Detroit, Wayne County and the state of Michigan as a whole. METHODS: Using cross-sectional TB surveillance data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, multivariable statistical models were developed to analyze the residence patterns of TB incidence from 2007 through 2012. Two-way interactions among the residence location and race of cases were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, Detroit residents experienced 58% greater TB incidence than residents of Wayne County or the state of Michigan. Racial inequalities were less pronounced in Detroit compared to both Wayne County and the state of Michigan. Blacks in Detroit had 2.01 times greater TB incidence than Whites, while this inequality was 3.62 times more in Wayne County and 8.72 greater in the state of Michigan. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight how race and place interact to influence patterns of TB disease, and the ways in which this interaction is context dependent. TB elimination in the U.S. will require strategies that address the local social environment, as much as the physical environment.",,pubmed

The negative economic impact of malaria has encouraged a new control approach targeting companies. In this regard, a cross sectional study was conducted from February 2015 to June 2017 in 14 companies in the town of Douala. This study aimed at determining the prevalence, control practices of employees and identifying associated factors with malaria. A total of 2705 workers were interviewed and systematically screened for malaria using LED fluorescence microscopy (CyScope(R)). All positive cases were given a malaria treatment. The prevalence of malaria and asymptomatic malaria was 30.1% and 28.9% respectively; asymptomatic malaria accounted for 95.7% of all positive diagnostic test. Malaria infection was significantly higher in employees aged 36-60 years (30.5%) and having completed primary studies (36%). ITNs ownership and utilization were 86.36% and 77.23% respectively. The risk for malaria infection has significantly decreased with age and educational level while the employees' level of education and size of households were significantly associated with the regular utilization of ITNs. This is the first study assessing malaria prevalence and risk factors in workplace in Cameroon and using a novel diagnostic tool. This study outlines a high prevalence of malaria infection, especially asymptomatic carriage, high rates of ITNs ownership and utilization, as well as the influence of level of education, age and household size as associated factors. Active case detection of asymptomatic carriers through systematic screening of employees at workplace and their treatment is feasible with the Cyscope microscope and could be a good complement to ongoing control strategies.",,pubmed

HIV infection is the main risk factor estimated to account for 95% of cases in the middle- and low-income countries and 80% of the cases in high-income countries. OBJECTIVE: The main aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and associated risk factors of Cryptococcal antigenemia (CrAg) among HIV/AIDS Patients on second-line ART Therapy at Ambo General Hospital and Nekemte Referral Hospital, Western Oromia, Ethiopia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hospital-based cross-sectional study was employed from September 1, 2017, to October 30, 2017. Whole blood was tested for CrAg using Cryptococcal lateral flow assay (Immuno-Mycologics, Norman, OK, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 software. Binary logistic regression models were applied to assess the association between predictors and outcome variables at 95% CI. RESULT: Among the study participants, 115(62.8%) were females and the median age of the participants was 35 (IQR: 14) years. Majority, 169(92.3%), have been living with HIV for >/= 5.6 years and 124 (67.8%) stayed on 2nd line ART for an average of 2.5 years.

The aim of the present study was to describe HIV knowledge, risk and the level of stigma among inhabitants of this border area. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 621 inhabitants over 18 years of age in the border cities of Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana and Oiapoque in Brazil. It was conducted between October 2017 and February 2018. An anonymous standardized questionnaire was filled out by culturally-trained mediators, then analyzed using STATA 12. RESULTS: Almost half (45.9%) of the individuals had a low education level. Participants whose native language was Portuguese or French demonstrated better HIV knowledge than other populations, notably native Amerindian and creole-speaking people. HIV risk behavior was more frequent in men and in younger age groups. People with good HIV knowledge reported having performed more HIV tests in the last year than participants with poor knowledge. The stigma level was high and reported in 74.8% of respondents. CONCLUSIONS: These results illustrate the need for initiatives to improve HIV prevention among autochthonous populations on both sides of this border area. Cross-border collaboration on health policies could produce common key messages adapted to the education level and multi-linguistic populations who live in this area.",,pubmed

Understanding variation in infection risk is essential for targeting interventions. METHODS: We develop an analytical approach to estimate household and exogenous forces of infection, while accounting for individual-level characteristics that affect susceptibility to disease and transmissibility. We apply this approach to a cohort study conducted in Lima, Peru, of 18,544 subjects in 4,500 households with at least one active tuberculosis (TB) case and compare the results to those obtained by Poisson and logistic regression. RESULTS: HIV-coinfected (susceptibility hazard ratio [SHR] = 3.80, 1.56-9.29), child (SHR = 1.72, 1.32-2.23), and teenage (SHR = 2.00, 1.49-2.68) household contacts of TB cases experience a higher hazard of TB than do adult contacts. Isoniazid preventive therapy (SHR = 0.30, 0.21-0.42) and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination (SHR = 0.66, 0.51-0.86) reduce the risk of disease among household contacts. TB cases without microbiological confirmation exert a smaller hazard of TB among their close contacts compared with smear- or culture-positive cases (excess hazard ratio = 0.88, 0.82-0.93 for HIV- cases and 0.82, 0.57-0.94 for HIV+ cases). The extra household force of infection results in 0.01 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.004, 0.028) TB cases per susceptible household contact per year and the rate of transmission between a microbiologically confirmed TB case and susceptible household contact at 0.08 (95% CI = 0.045, 0.129) TB cases per pair per year. CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for exposure to infected household contacts permits estimation of risk factors for disease susceptibility and transmissibility and comparison of within-household and exogenous forces of infection.",,pubmed

The City of Johannesburg, South Africa, is predicted to experience an average increase in ambient temperature of 4 degrees C by 2100. Focusing on the urban environment, this study aimed to determine socio-economic, infrastructural and health-related risk factors for heat-related adverse health effects. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. Data of interest were collected using a pretested and validated questionnaire administered to parents of children attending schools participating in a school heat study. Information related to demographic, socio-economic and household-level determinants of health, which has an impact on the individual prevalence of adverse heat-health effects associated with hot weather, was collected for 136 households and 580 individuals. RESULTS: Sweating (n = 208 individuals; 35%), headache and nausea (n = 111; 19%) and weakness, fatigue and dizziness (n = 87; 15%) were the most common heat-health effects reportedly experienced by individuals (n = 580) during hot weather. Individuals who suffered from hypertension (OR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.34 - 4.05, p = 0.003) and individuals older than 60 years (OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.27-1.99, p < 0.001) compared to other age groups were more likely to experience 'any heat-health effects'. Living in government-sponsored detached housing and in houses with asbestos roofs were associated with an increase in reported experience of 'any heat-health effects' compared to living in other housing types. CONCLUSION: Heat-health awareness campaigns should target people suffering from pre-existing diseases and the elderly, as these groups are especially vulnerable to heat. Focus should also be given to appropriate roofing and insulation in government-sponsored housing since summertime temperatures are projected to increase.",,pubmed

METHODS: Ecological descriptive study of deaths from tuberculosis with multivariate mapping and logistic regression, carried out from 2006 to 2017 in the 75 municipalities of Sergipe, Brazil. The focus of the analysis was the mean mortality rate from tuberculosis, dichotomised according to the median. The independent variables were selected based on the conceptual model of the social determinants of health. RESULTS: Mortality due to tuberculosis in Sergipe, Brazil, was most prevalent among males, mixed-race people, and people over 40 years old and with a low level of education. Multivariate logistic regression identified the mean incidence rate for tuberculosis (aOR: 1.06), the proportion of HIV testing (aOR: 7.10), people without primary education and with informal occupation (aOR: 1.26) and people living in urban households without waste collection service (aOR: 0.10) as determinants associated to municipalities with higher tuberculosis mortality rates, with area under the ROC curve of 84% (P-value 0.000). Mapping revealed evident spatial variability. CONCLUSIONS: The tuberculosis epidemic in Brazil is determined by access to health services, especially the provision of HIV testing among those diagnosed with tuberculosis, accelerated urbanisation with large pockets of poverty and unsanitary housing conditions, corroborating global trends.",,pubmed

We conducted a comprehensive and nationwide study on MDR-TB in 17 provinces for the period from June 2009 to June 2015, and a total of 1154 cases of MDR-TB were finally investigated. The study sought to assess the clinical features and contrast drug susceptibility profiles of MDR-TB patients in China. Cavitary disease, young age, and long duration of TB disease among MDR-TB patients were important predictors. A high resistance proportion of first-line drugs was observed in Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. Resistant proportions of second-line anti-TB drugs in western region for amikacin, aminosalicylic acid, and levofloxacin were higher than eastern and central regions. High levels of drug resistance were seen in earlier cases (before 2011) and outpatients. We found high levels of resistance to 1st- and 2nd-line drugs in all settings, with considerable variabilities in terms of different Directly Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS) programme, level of economic development(eastern, central and western regions) and patient source (inpatients and outpatients).

There are relatively few prospective data that integrate physical and mental maternal health measures with birth outcomes in low- and middle-income country settings. We aimed to investigate maternal health during pregnancy and the impact on birth outcomes in an African birth cohort study, the Drakenstein Child Health Study. METHODS: Pregnant women attending 2 public health clinics, Mbekweni (serving a predominantly black African population) and TC Newman (predominantly mixed ancestry) in a poor peri-urban area of South Africa were enrolled in their second trimester and followed through childbirth. All births occurred at a single public hospital. Maternal sociodemographic, physical and psychosocial characteristics were comprehensively assessed. Multivariable linear regression models were used to explore associations between maternal health and birth outcomes. RESULTS: Over 3 years, 1137 women (median age 25.8 years; 21% HIV-infected) gave birth to 1143 live babies. Most pregnancies were uncomplicated but gestational diabetes (1%), anaemia (22%) or pre-eclampsia (2%) occurred in a minority. Most households (87%) had a monthly income of less than USD 350; only 27% of moms were employed and food insecurity was common (37%). Most babies (80%) were born by vaginal delivery at full term; 17% were preterm, predominantly late preterm. Only 74 (7%) of babies required hospitalisation immediately after birth and only 2 babies were HIV-infected. Food insecurity, socioeconomic status, pregnancy-associated hypertension, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes and mixed ancestry were associated with lower infant gestational age while maternal BMI at enrolment was associated with higher infant gestational age. Primigravida or alcohol use during pregnancy were negatively associated with infant birth weight and head circumference. Maternal BMI at enrolment was positively associated with birth weight and gestational diabetes was positively associated with birth weight and head circumference for gestational age. Smoking during pregnancy was associated with lower infant birth weight. CONCLUSION: Several modifiable risk factors including food insecurity, smoking, and alcohol consumption during pregnancy were identified as associated with negative birth outcomes, all of which are amenable to public health interventions. Interventions to address key exposures influencing birth outcomes are needed to improve maternal and child health in low-middle income country settings.",,pubmed

To date, there is a paucity of information on HIV infection among PWUDs in remote Brazilian regions. This study determined the prevalence and factors associated with HIV-1 infection among PWUDs in northern Brazil. METHODS: Sociodemographic, economic, drug use and health-related information were collected through interviews from a community-recruited, multi-site sample of 1753 PWUDs. The blood samples collected were tested for the presence of HIV-1 using chemiluminescence immunoassay and PCR or western blotting. Logistic regressions identified factors independently associated with HIV-1 infection. RESULTS: In total, 266 (15.2%) PWUDs were HIV-1 positive. Hepatitis B virus and/or hepatitis C virus nucleic acid was detected in 65 (3.7%) PWUDs infected by HIV-1. The factors associated with HIV-1 infection were male gender, older age, a lower educational level and a lower income, crack cocaine use, a longer drug use history and a history of drug injection and engagement in unsafe sex, sex work and a higher number of sexual partners. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides unique, initial insights into HIV and co-infection status and pertinent risk factors among PWUDs in northern Brazil, with clear and diverse implications for urgently improved prevention and treatment intervention needs.",,pubmed

The aim of our study was to establish the clinical, radiological, bacteriological and prognostic features of pulmonary tuberculosis in patients with a history of incarceration. METHODS: Case-control study conducted between 2010 and 2016 in two pulmonology departments of Abderrahmane Mami Hospital. The cases were male patients, hospitalized for pulmonary tuberculosis with a history of incarceration. Three controls for one case were randomly selected from the list of male patients hospitalized for pulmonary tuberculosis in the same departments as the cases but with no history of incarceration. RESULTS: The study included 58 cases and 174 controls. The average age of cases was lower than in controls (36,5 years vs 43,4 years; p <0.001). The cases had a significantly worse socioeconomic conditions and educational level with no more frequent social coverage of the disease. Risk factors for TB (smoking, alcoholism, substance abuse, unprotected sex, tuberculosis contagion, viral hepatitis C) were significantly higher among cases. Weight loss and night sweats were significantly more common in both cases, as was undernutrition. Positive bacilloscopies prevailed in the cases (36,5 vs 43,4;p = 0.047). In controls, the institution delay was longer (4.38 days vs 10.24 days; p= 0.004) and the total duration of treatment was lower (7.16 mounths vs 6.55 mounths; p = 0.048).

Recurrence of tuberculosis complicates the situation further, and has severe negative economic and health consequences. This study estimated the tuberculosis recurrence rate during a 5-year follow-up period, and identified risk factors associated with recurrence.Methods: This was a prospective study with a 5-year follow-up period conducted at health centres with tuberculosis units in ten governorates. Participants were prospectively enrolled in the study from July 2007 to June 2008, with the last patient completing treatment on March 15, 2009.Results: A cohort of 814 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis completed treatment and was followed-up for five years. During the follow-up, 3.4% (n = 28) died and 4.3% (n = 35) were lost to the study, giving a final cohort of 751 patients. The mean age +/- standard deviation was 32 +/- 13 years. Males represented 57.6% of the subjects. The overall recurrence rate of tuberculosis was 9.5% (71/751), with significant variation between subgroups of patients (range = 7-25.8%). The highest recurrence rates were found in patients with diabetes (25.8%, p < .001), non-adherent patients (22%, p < .001), smokers (16.1%, p = .010), patients with cavitary lung disease (14.4%, p = .004), patients with weight gain </=5% during the intensive phase (13.3%, p < .001) and unemployed patients (11.9%, p = .017). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, these risk factors were independently associated with recurrent tuberculosis: diabetes (adjusted odds ratio, aOR 3.78, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.84-7.80), non-adherence (aOR 3.22, 95% CI 1.76-5.87), weight gain </=5% (aOR 2.51, 95% CI 1.39-4.55), smoking (aOR 2.18, 95% CI 1.07-4.47), presence of lung cavitation (aOR 2.01, 95% CI 1.16-3.46), and unemployment (aOR 2.15, 95% CI 1.16-4.01).Conclusion: The recurrence rate of tuberculosis in Yemen was high. The presence of risk factors in newly diagnosed patients should alert healthcare professionals. As most of risk factors were modifiable, the World Health Organisation model of patient-centered care in tuberculosis treatment should be promoted in all tuberculosis centres in the country.",,pubmed

Since antiretroviral drugs may also inhibit hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication, analyzing the impact of ART on management of hepatitis B in this population is important. OBJECTIVE: To assess HBV viremia among HIV/HBV coinfected individuals on ART and its associated factors. METHOD: For this cross-sectional study, HIV/HBV-coinfected individuals, aged over 18 years, who were on ART for over six months and receiving care at an outpatient clinic in Sao Paulo were recruited. Sociodemographic characteristics, information about viral exposure, clinical and laboratory data, including evaluation of liver fibrosis were obtained. Plasma HBV DNA was measured by polymerase chain reaction. Viral genome sequencing was conducted for genotyping and identification of drug resistance-conferring mutations if viral load exceeded 900 IU/mL. RESULTS: Out of 2,946 patients who attended the clinic in 2015, 83 were eligible and 56 evaluated. Plasma HBV DNA was detected in 16 (28.6%) (95% CI: 18.0-41.3%), all on lamivudine and tenofovir treatment. HBV DNA detection was associated with lower education (p = 0.015), higher international normalized ratios (p = 0.045), history of an AIDS-defining illness [OR: 3.43 (95% CI: 1.10-11.50)], and HBeAg detection [OR: 6.60 (95% CI: 1.84-23.6)]. In contrast, a last CD4+ count above 500 cells/mm(3) in the year prior to inclusion [OR: 0.18 (95% CI: 0.04-0.71)] and detection of anti-HBe [OR: 0.21 (95% CI: 0.04-0.99)] were negatively associated. Patients with HBV DNA above 900 IU/mL were infected with subgenotypes A1 (n = 3) and D2 (n = 1), and exhibited viral mutations associated with total resistance to lamivudine and partial resistance to entecavir. CONCLUSIONS: Despite being on ART, a significant proportion of HIV/HBV-coinfected individuals present HBV viremia.

MI is classified into types, predominantly atheroembolic type 1 MI (T1MI) and supply-demand mismatch type 2 MI (T2MI). We examined the association between HCV and MI among patients in the Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR) Network of Integrated Clinical Systems, a US multicenter clinical cohort of PLWH. MIs were centrally adjudicated and categorized by type using the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. We estimated the association between chronic HCV (RNA+) and time to MI while adjusting for demographic characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors, clinical characteristics, and history of injecting drug use. Among 23,407 PLWH aged >/=18 years, there were 336 T1MIs and 330 T2MIs during a median of 4.7 years of follow-up between 1998 and 2016. HCV was associated with a 46% greater risk of T2MI (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09, 1.97) but not T1MI (aHR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.58, 1.29). In an exploratory cause-specific analysis of T2MI, HCV was associated with a 2-fold greater risk of T2MI attributed to sepsis (aHR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.25, 3.24). Extrahepatic manifestations of HCV in this high-risk population are an important area for continued research.",,pubmed

METHODS: Culture-confirmed TB cases reported to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (2004-2012) were analyzed for time-restricted genotypic and/or geospatial clustering. Cases with both types of clustering were used as a proxy for recent, local transmission. Modified, multivariate Poisson regression models were fit to estimate this prevalence in relation to various individual- and neighborhood-level demographic and socio-economic variables. RESULTS: Those individuals that were spatially clustered were 1.7 times as likely to also be time-restricted genotypically clustered. The prevalence of recent, local transmission was higher among U.S.-born cases, males, and non-Hispanic blacks. Moreover, people living in neighborhoods in the highest poverty quartile had 13.8 times the prevalence of recent, local transmission compared with those in the lowest poverty neighborhoods. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest geographic areas with high concentration of TB cases are likely driven by ongoing transmission, rather than enclaves of individuals who have reactivated a case of latent TB. Furthermore, efforts to continue reducing Mtb transmission in the United States, and other low-incidence settings, must better identify community-level sources of risk, manifested through the complex social interactions among people and their environments.",,pubmed

This paper examines the factors behind the rapid increase in internationally traded food prices since 2002 and estimates the contribution of various factors such as the increased production of biofuels from food grains and oilseeds, the weak dollar, and the increase in food production costs due to higher energy prices. It concludes that the most important factor was the large increase in biofuels production in the U.S. and the EU. Without these increases, global wheat and maize stocks would not have declined appreciably, oilseed prices would not have tripled, and price increases due to other factors, such as droughts, would have been more moderate. Recent export bans and speculative activities would probably not have occurred because they were largely responses to rising prices. While it is difficult to compare the results of this study with those of other studies due to differences in methodologies, time periods and prices considered, many other studies have also recognized biofuels production as a major driver of food prices. The contribution of biofuels to the rise in food prices raises an important policy issue, since much of the increase was due to EU and U.S. government policies that provided incentives to biofuels production, and biofuels policies which subsidize production need to be reconsidered in light of their impact on food prices.

Corwyn,2002.0,,"▪ Abstract Socioeconomic status (SES) is one of the most widely studied constructs in the social sciences. Several ways of measuring SES have been proposed, but most include some quantification of family income, parental education, and occupational status. Research shows that SES is associated with a wide array of health, cognitive, and socioemotional outcomes in children, with effects beginning prior to birth and continuing into adulthood. A variety of mechanisms linking SES to child well-being have been proposed, with most involving differences in access to material and social resources or reactions to stress-inducing conditions by both the children themselves and their parents. For children, SES impacts well-being at multiple levels, including both family and neighborhood. Its effects are moderated by children's own characteristics, family characteristics, and external support systems.",https://openalex.org/W2171357886,openalex

Climate for service rests on the foundation issues, but in addition it requires policies and practices that focus attention directly on service quality. Data were collected at multiple points in time from employees and customers of 134 branches of a bank and analyzed via structural equation modeling. Results indicated that the model in which the foundation issues yielded a climate for service, and climate for service in turn led to customer perceptions of service quality, fit the data well.

A535,"Polarization, Horizontal Inequalities and Violent Civil Conflict",https://doi.org/10.1177/0022343307087169,Gudrun Østby,2008.0,,"Recent large-N studies of civil war conclude that inequality does not increase the risk of violent conflict. This article argues that such conclusions may be premature because these studies, which usually test the conflict potential of `vertical inequality' (i.e. income inequality between individuals), tend to neglect the group aspect of inequality. Case studies suggest that what matters for conflict is a concept closely linked to both economic and ethnic polarization: `horizontal inequalities', or inequalities that coincide with identity-based cleavages. Horizontal inequalities may enhance both grievances and group cohesion among the relatively deprived and thus facilitate mobilization for conflict. This article provides a quantitative test of this argument, exploring whether various forms of polarization and horizontal inequalities affect the probability of civil conflict onset across 36 developing countries in the period 1986—2004. National household data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) are used to construct measures of ethnic, social and economic polarization, as well as vertical and horizontal inequalities along two dimensions: social and economic. The article also introduces a combined measure of ethnic/socio-economic polarization as an alternative to the horizontal inequality measure. Robust results from panel and cross-section analyses show that social polarization and horizontal social inequality are positively related to conflict outbreak. Variables for purely ethnic polarization, inter-individual inequalities and combined ethnic/socio-economic polarization are not significant.",https://openalex.org/W2116212710,openalex

If these predictions are realized, climate warming may have a more profound impact on the functioning and diversity of tropical forests than currently anticipated. Although arthropods comprise over two-thirds of terrestrial species, information on their abundance and extinction rates in tropical habitats is severely limited. Here we analyze data on arthropod and insectivore abundances taken between 1976 and 2012 at two midelevation habitats in Puerto Rico's Luquillo rainforest. During this time, mean maximum temperatures have risen by 2.0 °C. Using the same study area and methods employed by Lister in the 1970s, we discovered that the dry weight biomass of arthropods captured in sweep samples had declined 4 to 8 times, and 30 to 60 times in sticky traps. Analysis of long-term data on canopy arthropods and walking sticks taken as part of the Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research program revealed sustained declines in abundance over two decades, as well as negative regressions of abundance on mean maximum temperatures. We also document parallel decreases in Luquillo's insectivorous lizards, frogs, and birds. While El Niño/Southern Oscillation influences the abundance of forest arthropods, climate warming is the major driver of reductions in arthropod abundance, indirectly precipitating a bottom-up trophic cascade and consequent collapse of the forest food web.",https://openalex.org/W2896548525,openalex

The impact of these events can be due to a single variable being in an extreme state, but more often it is the result of a combination of variables not all of which are necessarily extreme. Here, the combination of variables or events that lead to an extreme impact is referred to as a compound event. Any given compound event will depend upon the nature and number of physical variables, the range of spatial and temporal scales, the strength of dependence between processes, and the perspective of the stakeholder who defines the impact. Modeling compound events is a large, complex, and interdisciplinary undertaking. To facilitate this task we propose the use of influence diagrams for defining, mapping, analyzing, modeling, and communicating the risk of the compound event. Ultimately, a greater appreciation of compound events will lead to further insight and a changed perspective on how impact risks are associated with climate‐related hazards.

Prior theory and cross-sectional data suggest that among higher SES persons the onset of health problems is usually postponed until rather late in life, while health declines are prevalent in lower SES groups by middle age. Thus, SES differences in health are small in early adulthood, but increase with age until relatively late in life, when they diminish due to selection or greater equalization of health risks and protections. The present paper strengthens our causal and interpretive understanding of these phenomena by showing: (1) that results previously reported for indices of SES hold separately for education and income; (2) that the interaction between age and SES (i.e., education or income) in predicting health can be substantially explained by the greater exposure of lower SES persons to a wide range of psychosocial risk factors to health, especially in middle and early old age, and, to a lesser degree, the greater impact of these risk factors on health with age; and (3) that results (1) and (2) generally hold in short-term longitudinal as well as in cross-sectional data.

Paralleling the COVID-19 pandemic crisis have been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis use disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. We examined the genetic relationship between CUD and COVID-19 hospitalization. We estimated the genetic correlation between CUD (case: n = 14,080; control: n = 343,726) and COVID-19 hospitalization (case: n = 9373; control: n = 1,197,256) using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. Using independent genome-wide association studies conducted before the pandemic, we controlled for several covariates (i.e., tobacco use phenotypes, problematic alcohol use, body mass index, fasting glucose, forced expiratory volume, education attainment, risk taking, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Townsend deprivation index, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes) using genomic structural equation modeling. Genetic causality between CUD and COVID-19 hospitalization was estimated using latent causal variable models. Genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 was correlated with genetic liability to CUD (rG = 0.423 [SE = 0.0965], p = 1.33 × 10−6); this association remained when accounting for genetic liability to related risk factors and covariates (b = 0.381–0.539, p = .012–.049). Latent causal variable analysis revealed causal effect estimates that were not statistically significant. Problematic cannabis use and vulnerability to serious COVID-19 complications share genetic underpinnings that are unique from common correlates.

There is growing concern that flooding is becoming more frequent and severe in Europe. A better understanding of flood regime changes and their drivers is therefore needed. The paper reviews the current knowledge on flood regime changes in European rivers that has traditionally been obtained through two alternative research approaches. The first approach is the data-based detection of changes in observed flood events. Current methods are reviewed together with their challenges and opportunities. For example, observation biases, the merging of different data sources and accounting for nonlinear drivers and responses. The second approach consists of modelled scenarios of future floods. Challenges and opportunities associated with flood change scenarios are discussed such as fully accounting for uncertainties in the modelling cascade and feedbacks. To make progress in flood change research, we suggest that a synthesis of these two approaches is needed. This can be achieved by focusing on long duration records and flood-rich and flood-poor periods rather than on short duration flood trends only, by formally attributing causes of observed flood changes, by validating scenarios against observed flood regime dynamics, and by developing low-dimensional models of flood changes and feedbacks. The paper finishes with a call for a joint European flood change research network.",https://openalex.org/W2012408626,openalex

However, these intuitive distinctions can become blurred when comparing species distribution modelling approaches in more detail. In this review article, we contrast the extremes of the correlative–process spectrum of species distribution models with respect to core assumptions, model building and selection strategies, validation, uncertainties, common errors and the questions they are most suited to answer. The extremes of such approaches differ clearly in many aspects, such as model building approaches, parameter estimation strategies and transferability. However, they also share strengths and weaknesses. We show that claims of one approach being intrinsically superior to the other are misguided and that they ignore the process–correlation continuum as well as the domains of questions that each approach is addressing. Nonetheless, the application of process‐based approaches to species distribution modelling lags far behind more correlative (process‐implicit) methods and more research is required to explore their potential benefits. Critical issues for the employment of species distribution modelling approaches are given, together with a guideline for appropriate usage.

We first argue that social inquiry and its methods are productive: they (help to) make social realities and social worlds. They do not simply describe the world as it is, but also enact it. Second, we suggest that, if social investigation makes worlds, then it can, in some measure, think about the worlds it wants to help to make. It gets involved in ‘ontological politics’. We then go on to show that its methods - and its politics - are still stuck in, and tend to reproduce, nineteenth-century, nation-state-based politics. How might we move social science from the enactment of nineteenth-century realities? We argue that social-and-physical changes in the world are - and need to be - paralleled by changes in the methods of social inquiry. The social sciences need to re-imagine themselves, their methods, and their ‘worlds’ if they are to work productively in the twenty-first century where social relations appear increasingly complex, elusive, ephemeral, and unpredictable. There are various possibilities: perhaps, for instance, there is need for ‘messy’ methods.

We reviewed the evidence for phenotypic responses to recent climate change in fish. Changes in the timing of migration and reproduction, age at maturity, age at juvenile migration, growth, survival and fecundity were associated primarily with changes in temperature. Although these traits can evolve rapidly, only two studies attributed phenotypic changes formally to evolutionary mechanisms. The correlation‐based methods most frequently employed point largely to ‘fine‐grained’ population responses to environmental variability (i.e. rapid phenotypic changes relative to generation time), consistent with plastic mechanisms. Ultimately, many species will likely adapt to long‐term warming trends overlaid on natural climate oscillations. Considering the strong plasticity in all traits studied, we recommend development and expanded use of methods capable of detecting evolutionary change, such as the long term study of selection coefficients and temporal shifts in reaction norms, and increased attention to forecasting adaptive change in response to the synergistic interactions of the multiple selection pressures likely to be associated with climate change.",https://openalex.org/W2056659223,openalex

Climate determinism previously offered an explanation, and hence a justification, for the superiority of certain imperial races and cultures. The argument put forward here is that the new climate reductionism is driven by the hegemony exercised by the predictive natural sciences over contingent, imaginative, and humanistic accounts of social life and visions of the future. It is a hegemony that lends disproportionate power in political and social discourse to model-based descriptions of putative future climates. Some possible reasons for this climate reductionism, as well as some of the limitations and dangers of this position for human relationships with the future, are suggested.",https://openalex.org/W1982404479,openalex

We argue that residential segregation created a unique niche of poor minority clients who were differentially marketed risky subprime loans that were in great demand for use in mortgage-backed securities that could be sold on secondary markets. We test this argument by regressing foreclosure actions in the top 100 U.S. metropolitan areas on measures of black, Hispanic, and Asian segregation while controlling for a variety of housing market conditions, including average creditworthiness, the extent of coverage under the Community Reinvestment Act, the degree of zoning regulation, and the overall rate of subprime lending. We find that black residential dissimilarity and spatial isolation are powerful predictors of foreclosures across U.S. metropolitan areas. In order to isolate subprime lending as the causal mechanism whereby segregation influences foreclosures, we estimate a two-stage least squares model that confirms the causal effect of black segregation on the number and rate of foreclosures across metropolitan areas. In the United States segregation was an important contributing cause of the foreclosure crisis, along with overbuilding, risky lending practices, lax regulation, and the bursting of the housing price bubble.",https://openalex.org/W2110446249,openalex
A583,A Physics-Informed Auto-Learning Framework for Developing Stochastic Conceptual Models for ENSO Diversity,https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-24-0092.1,Yinling Zhang; Nan Chen; Jérôme Vialard; Xianghui Fang,2024.0,,"Abstract Understanding El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) dynamics has tremendously improved over the past few decades. The ENSO diversity in spatial pattern, peak intensity, and temporal evolution is, however, still poorly represented in conceptual ENSO models. In this paper, a physics-informed auto-learning framework is applied to derive ENSO stochastic conceptual models with varying degrees of freedom. The framework is computationally efficient and easy to apply. Once the state vector of the target model is set, causal inference is exploited to build the right-hand side of the equations based on a mathematical function library. Fundamentally different from standard nonlinear regression, the auto-learning framework provides a parsimonious model by retaining only terms that improve the dynamical consistency with observations. It can also identify crucial latent variables and provide physical explanations. This methodology successfully reconstructs the equations of a realistic six-dimensional reference ENSO model based on the recharge oscillator theory from its data. A hierarchy of lower-dimensional models is derived, and their representation of ENSO (including its diversity) is systematically assessed. The minimum model that represents ENSO diversity is four-dimensional, with three interannual variables describing the western Pacific thermocline depth, the eastern and central Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and one intraseasonal variable for westerly wind events. Without the intraseasonal variable, the resulting three-dimensional model underestimates extreme events and is too regular. A limited number of weak nonlinearities in the model are essential in reproducing the observed extreme El Niño events and the observed nonlinear relationship between eastern and western Pacific SSTs. Significance Statement This study develops a physics-informed auto-learning approach to improve the modeling and understanding of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a major climate phenomenon influencing global weather and climate. The auto-learning framework explores the causality between key processes to systematically produce stochastic conceptual models with different climate factors that simulate the diversity of observed ENSO events. The key finding is that the minimal model for characterizing the ENSO diversity (with the least number of climate factors) is a four-variable model capturing thermocline depth, sea surface temperatures, and wind bursts that can reproduce intensity and spatial pattern variation. This advancement provides an interpretable tool to identify the minimum sufficient processes governing ENSO behavior for improved predictability.",https://openalex.org/W4402775825,openalex

A585,Social inequalities in health disentangling the underlying mechanisms.,,Noreen Goldman,2001.0,,"Differentials in health and longevity by socioeconomic status and by the nature of social relationships have been found in innumerable studies in the social and medical sciences. Three categories of explanations for the observed patterns have been proposed: causal mechanisms through which the social environment affects health status or the risk of dying; selection or reverse causal pathways whereby a person's health status affects their social position; and artifactual mechanisms, such as measurement error. The general consensus among researchers is that the observed disparities in health are driven largely by a complex set of causal processes rather than by selection or by artifactual mechanisms. This paper explores the set of arguments and strategies that researchers have used to arrive at this conclusion. As part of this undertaking, we assess whether inferences regarding the minor contribution of selection to the overall association between social factors and health are justifiable.

Our analysis has three focal points: the relative contributions of state dependence and heterogeneity in explaining the dynamics of health, the existence and consequences of health‐related sample attrition, and the investigation of the effects of measures of socioeconomic status, with a particular focus on educational attainment and income. To investigate these issues we use dynamic panel ordered probit models. There is clear evidence of health‐related attrition in the data but this does not distort the estimates of state dependence and of the socioeconomic gradient in health. The models show strong positive state dependence and heterogeneity accounts for around 30% of the unexplained variation in health.

We argue that the carbon balance approach is readily applicable for projecting forest yield and productivity, and review several carbon balance models for estimating stand productivity and individual tree growth and competition.

We review model calibration and validation methods that take account of the hybrid character of models.

Structural equation modeling indicates that elite cues, movement advocacy efforts, weather, and structural economic factors influence the level of public concern about climate change. While media coverage exerts an important influence, it is itself largely a function of elite cues and economic factors.

Here, we suggest strategies assembled from diverse disciplines, including ecology, epidemiology, and the social sciences, to analyze complex relationships, promote cooperation, increase efficiency, and minimize bias when investigating the ecological drivers of disease emergence. These techniques, which complement traditional hypothesis testing, include epidemiologic causal criteria, strong inference, causal diagrams, model selection, and triangulation. We also present several examples from recent emerging infectious disease investigations, including Hendra virus, Nipah virus, coral diseases, and avian influenza, where these techniques were successfully applied.

This study is the first to investigate the interrelated nature of these variables by contrasting three prominent social-psychological theories. In the first model, affect is viewed as a fast and associative information processing heuristic that guides perceptions of risk. In the second model, affect is seen as flowing from cognitive appraisals (i.e., affect is thought of as a post-cognitive process). Lastly, a third, dual-process model is advanced that integrates aspects from both theoretical perspectives. Four structural equation models were tested on a national sample (N = 808) of British respondents. Results initially provide support for the ""cognitive"" model, where personal experience with extreme weather is best conceptualized as a predictor of climate change risk perception and, in turn, risk perception a predictor of affect. Yet, closer examination strongly indicates that at the same time, risk perception and affect reciprocally influence each other in a stable feedback system. It is therefore concluded that both theoretical claims are valid and that a dual-process perspective provides a superior fit to the data. Implications for theory and risk communication are discussed. © 2014 The Authors. European Journal of Social Psychology published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",https://openalex.org/W2132441266,openalex

Menegaki,2019.0,,"This paper examines the causal relationships between economic growth, energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in high-income and upper-middle-income countries using the simultaneous equations framework, with data from 1985 to 2011. By taking institutional quality (measured by the level of corruption) and climate (measured by average temperatures over the winter and summer months) into account, this is the first study to incorporate both of these factors into a simultaneous equations model within the energy-environment-growth nexus. The dependent variables in the system of three simultaneous equations are real gross domestic product (GDP), energy consumption and CO2 emissions as a proxy for air pollution. The results have two important implications. First, they document a bidirectional causal relationship between GDP and energy consumption but do not provide support for the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. This is revolutionary in the sense that it indicates that high-income and upper-middle-income countries base their economic growth on a feedback relationship with energy consumption and that the ensuing pollution has not yet reached a maximum point, even in these countries. Second, by implying that climate and weather variations are more important determinants of energy consumption and CO2 emissions than corruption, the results suggest that changes in institutional quality are likely to have only a limited impact on energy and environmental policies.",https://openalex.org/W2918145827,openalex

Need fulfillment was consistently associated with SWB across world regions. Life evaluation was most associated with fulfilling basic needs; positive feelings were most associated with social and respect needs; and negative feelings were most associated with basic, respect, and autonomy needs. Societal need fulfillment predicted SWB, particularly for life evaluation, beyond individuals' fulfillment of their own needs, indicating the desirability of living in a flourishing society. In addition, the associations of SWB with the fulfillment of specific needs were largely independent of whether other needs were fulfilled. These trends persisted when household income was taken into account. The emergent ordering of need fulfillment for psychosocial needs were fairly consistent across country conditions, but the fulfillment of basic and safety needs were contingent on country membership.",https://openalex.org/W2099772303,openalex

These concepts are becoming ever more central to the resilience debate. They aggregate elements of climate change adaptation, critical infrastructure protection, and societal resilience in the face of complex, high‐impact events. However, despite the potential of these concepts to link together diverse disciplines, scholars and practitioners need to avoid treating them in a superficial or ambiguous manner. Overlapping uses and definitions could generate confusion and lead to the duplication of research effort. This article gives an overview of the state of the art regarding compound, interconnected, interacting, and cascading risks. It is intended to help build a coherent basis for the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR). The main objective is to propose a holistic framework that highlights the complementarities of the four kinds of complex risk in a manner that is designed to support the work of researchers and policymakers. This article suggests how compound, interconnected, interacting, and cascading risks could be used, with little or no redundancy, as inputs to new analyses and decisional tools designed to support the implementation of the SFDRR. The findings can be used to improve policy recommendations and support tools for emergency and crisis management, such as scenario building and impact trees, thus contributing to the achievement of a system‐wide approach to resilience.",https://openalex.org/W2808626396,openalex

However, tropical countries have much weaker annual climate cycles, and outbreaks show less seasonality and are more difficult to explain with environmental correlations. Here, we use convergent cross mapping, a robust test for causality that does not require correlation, to test alternative hypotheses about the global environmental drivers of influenza outbreaks from country-level epidemic time series. By moving beyond correlation, we show that despite the apparent differences in outbreak patterns between temperate and tropical countries, absolute humidity and, to a lesser extent, temperature drive influenza outbreaks globally. We also find a hypothesized U-shaped relationship between absolute humidity and influenza that is predicted by theory and experiment, but hitherto has not been documented at the population level. The balance between positive and negative effects of absolute humidity appears to be mediated by temperature, and the analysis reveals a key threshold around 75 °F.

We review both locationist and psychological constructionist hypotheses of brain-emotion correspondence and report meta-analytic findings bearing on these hypotheses. Overall, we found little evidence that discrete emotion categories can be consistently and specifically localized to distinct brain regions. Instead, we found evidence that is consistent with a psychological constructionist approach to the mind: A set of interacting brain regions commonly involved in basic psychological operations of both an emotional and non-emotional nature are active during emotion experience and perception across a range of discrete emotion categories.",https://openalex.org/W2105931454,openalex

The analysis combines satellite-based measures of air pollution with statistics on regional economic activity at the NUTS-3 level throughout the European Union over the period 2000-15. An instrumental variables approach based on thermal inversions is used to identify the causal impact of air pollution on economic activity. The estimates show that a 1μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration (or a 10% increase at the sample mean) causes a 0.8% reduction in real GDP that same year. Ninety-five per cent of this impact is due to reductions in output per worker, which can occur through greater absenteeism at work or reduced labour productivity. Therefore, the results suggest that public policies to reduce air pollution may contribute positively to economic growth. Indeed, the large economic benefits from pollution reduction uncovered in the study compare with relatively small abatement costs. Thus, more stringent air quality regulations could be warranted based solely on economic grounds, even ignoring the large benefits in terms of avoided mortality.",https://openalex.org/W2996395020,openalex

The wavelet transform (WT) has been successfully applied over an extraordinary range of fields in order to decompose the non-stationary TS into time-frequency domain. For this reason, the WT method is briefly introduced and reviewed in this paper. In addition, this latter includes different research and applications of the WT to non-stationary TS in seven different applied sciences fields, namely the geo-sciences and geophysics, remote sensing in vegetation analysis, engineering, hydrology, finance, medicine, and other fields, such as ecology, renewable energy, chemistry and history.

In spite of a growing level of interest and progress in determining climate change effects on infectious disease, the debate on the potential health outcomes remains polarizing, which is partly attributable to the varying effects of climate change, different types of pathogen-host systems, and spatio-temporal scales. We summarize the published evidence and show that over the past few decades, the reported negative or uncertain responses of infectious diseases to climate change has been growing. A feature of the research tendency is the focus on temperature and insect-borne diseases at the local and decadal scale. Geographically, regions experiencing higher temperature anomalies have been given more research attention; unfortunately, the Earth's most vulnerable regions to climate variability and extreme events have been less studied. From local to global scales, agreements on the response of infectious diseases to climate change tend to converge. So far, an abundance of findings have been based on statistical methods, with the number of mechanistic studies slowly growing.

Martinson,2000.0,,"This study statistically evaluates the relationship between Antarctic sea ice extent and global climate variability. Temporal cross correlations between detrended Antarctic sea ice edge (SIE) anomaly and various climate indices are calculated. For the sea surface temperature (SST) in the eastern equatorial Pacific and tropical Indian Ocean, as well as the tropical Pacific precipitation, a coherent propagating pattern is clearly evident in all correlations with the spatially averaged (over 12° longitude) detrended SIE anomalies (〈SIE*〉). Correlations with ENSO indices imply that up to 34% of the variance in 〈SIE*〉 is linearly related to ENSO. The 〈SIE*〉 has even higher correlations with the tropical Pacific precipitation and SST in the tropical Indian Ocean. In addition, correlation of 〈SIE*〉 with global surface temperature produces four characteristic correlation patterns: 1) an ENSO-like pattern in the Tropics with strong correlations in the Indian Ocean and North America (r > 0.6); 2) a teleconnection pattern between the eastern Pacific region of the Antarctic and western–central tropical Pacific; 3) an Antarctic dipole across the Drake Passage; and 4) meridional banding structures in the central Pacific and Atlantic expending from polar regions to the Tropics, even to the Northern Hemisphere. The SIE anomalies in the Amundsen Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, and Weddell Gyre of the Antarctic polar ocean sectors show the strongest polar links to extrapolar climate. Linear correlations between 〈SIE*〉 in those regions and global climate parameters pass a local significance test at the 95% confidence level. The field significance, designed to account for spatial coherence in the surface temperature, is evaluated using quasiperiodic colored noise that is more appropriate than white noise. The fraction of the globe displaying locally significant correlations (at the 95% confidence level) between 〈SIE*〉 and global temperature is significantly larger, at the 99.5% confidence level, than the fraction expected given quasiperiodic colored noise in place of the 〈SIE*〉. Based on EOF analysis and multiplicity theory, the four teleconnection patterns the authors found are the ones reflecting correlations most likely to be physically meaningful.",https://openalex.org/W2175519760,openalex

Tomas,2012.0,,"Abstract Arctic sea ice is declining at an increasing rate with potentially important repercussions. To understand better the atmospheric changes that may have occurred in response to Arctic sea ice loss, this study presents results from atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiments in which the only time-varying forcings prescribed were observed variations in Arctic sea ice and accompanying changes in Arctic sea surface temperatures from 1979 to 2009. Two independent AGCMs are utilized in order to assess the robustness of the response across different models. The results suggest that the atmospheric impacts of Arctic sea ice loss have been manifested most strongly within the maritime and coastal Arctic and in the lowermost atmosphere. Sea ice loss has driven increased energy transfer from the ocean to the atmosphere, enhanced warming and moistening of the lower troposphere, decreased the strength of the surface temperature inversion, and increased lower-tropospheric thickness; all of these changes are most pronounced in autumn and early winter (September–December). The early winter (November–December) atmospheric circulation response resembles the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO); however, the NAO-type response is quite weak and is often masked by intrinsic (unforced) atmospheric variability. Some evidence of a late winter (March–April) polar stratospheric cooling response to sea ice loss is also found, which may have important implications for polar stratospheric ozone concentrations. The attribution and quantification of other aspects of the possible atmospheric response are hindered by model sensitivities and large intrinsic variability. The potential remote responses to Arctic sea ice change are currently hard to confirm and remain uncertain.",https://openalex.org/W2074383937,openalex

The major exception is that, among blacks, early marriage is unrelated to family background. Several explanations for intergenerational consequences are tested, including the economic-deprivation hypothesis, the socialization hypothesis, and the stress hypothesis.

Multivariate Panel Data Evidence for EU-28 Countries,https://doi.org/10.3390/en10030381,Daniel Armeanu; Georgeta Vintilă; Ștefan Cristian Gherghina,2017.0,,"Energy is crucial to economic progress, but the contemporary worldwide population increase that demands greater energy generated from conventional exhaustible resources, an energy price upsurge, and environmental concerns, imperils sustainable economic growth. Nevertheless, switching to renewable energy produced from naturally replenished resources promotes energy security, likewise addressing issues such as global warming and climate change. This paper aims at exploring the influence and causal relation between renewable energy, both overall and by type, and sustainable economic growth of European Union (EU)-28 countries for the period of 2003–2014. We notice that the mean share of renewable energy in the gross final energy consumption is 15%, while the mean share of renewable energy in transport fuel consumption is 3%, which are below the thresholds of 20% and 10%, respectively, as set by the EU Directive 2009/28/EC. By estimating panel data fixed-effects regression models, the results provide support for a positive influence of renewable energy overall, as well as by type, namely biomass, hydropower, geothermal energy, wind power, and solar energy on gross domestic product per capita. However, biomass energy shows the highest influence on economic growth among the rest of renewable energy types. In fact, a 1% increase of the primary production of solid biofuels increases GDP per capita by 0.16%. Besides, cointegrating regressions set on panel fully modified and dynamic ordinary least squares regressions confirm the positive influence related to the primary production of renewable energies on economic growth. A 1% increase in primary production of renewable energies increases GDP per capita by 0.05%–0.06%. However, the results of Granger causality based on panel vector error correction model indicate both in short-run and long-run a unidirectional causal relationship running from sustainable economic growth to the primary production of renewable energies, being supported the conservation hypothesis.",https://openalex.org/W2596293608,openalex

Since the beginning of 2020, this stability has been undergoing one of the most vigorous pressure tests ever due to the COVID-19 outbreak. From a mere health issue, the pandemic has turned into an economic threat to food security globally in the forms of lockdowns, economic decline, food trade restrictions, and rising food inflation. It is safe to assume that the novel health crisis has badly struck the least developed and developing economies, where people are particularly vulnerable to hunger and malnutrition. However, due to the recency of the COVID-19 problem, the impacts of macroeconomic fluctuations on food insecurity have remained scantily explored. In this study, the authors attempted to bridge this gap by revealing interactions between the food security status of people and the dynamics of COVID-19 cases, food trade, food inflation, and currency volatilities. The study was performed in the cases of 45 developing economies distributed to three groups by the level of income. The consecutive application of the autoregressive distributed lag method, Yamamoto’s causality test, and variance decomposition analysis allowed the authors to find the food insecurity effects of COVID-19 to be more perceptible in upper-middle-income economies than in the least developed countries. In the latter, food security risks attributed to the emergence of the health crisis were mainly related to economic access to adequate food supply (food inflation), whereas in higher-income developing economies, availability-sided food security risks (food trade restrictions and currency depreciation) were more prevalent. The approach presented in this paper contributes to the establishment of a methodology framework that may equip decision-makers with up-to-date estimations of health crisis effects on economic parameters of food availability and access to staples in food-insecure communities.",https://openalex.org/W3048185517,openalex

Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire was completed by 275 adults that assessed personality factors as well as environmental beliefs and religiosity. The design was cross‐sectional, and correlational analyses determined the associations between climate change distress and symptoms indicative of depression, anxiety and stress. Independent samples t ‐tests and ANOVA revealed group differences for age and gender. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to identify important, unique predictors and to determine the extent to which environmental beliefs, future anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty and religiosity accounted for the variability in climate change measures beyond the effects of age and gender. Findings This study indicates that the public is becoming increasingly concerned about climate change and that there is a relationship between this concern and symptoms that are indicative of depression, anxiety and stress. The results indicate that an individual is more likely to be distressed about climate change if they are female, under the age of 35 years, have a pro‐environmental orientation, and possess personality traits such as high levels of future anxiety. Originality/value Bringing attention to the existence of climate change distress, understanding the extent of these fears and what makes a person vulnerable will be helpful in the treatment and prevention of general and clinical levels of climate‐related distress.",https://openalex.org/W1975022459,openalex

Daily Temperature and Income in the United States,https://doi.org/10.3386/w20750,Tatyana Deryugina; Solomon Hsiang,2014.0,,"It is widely hypothesized that incomes in wealthy countries are insulated from environmental conditions because individuals have the resources needed to adapt to their environment.We test this idea in the wealthiest economy in human history.Using within-county variation in weather, we estimate the effect of daily temperature on annual income in United States counties over a 40-year period.We find that this single environmental parameter continues to play a large role in overall economic performance: productivity of individual days declines roughly 1.7% for each 1°C (1.8°F) increase in daily average temperature above 15°C (59°F).A weekday above 30°C (86°F) costs an average county $20 per person.Hot weekends have little effect.These estimates are net of many forms of adaptation, such as factor reallocation, defensive investments, transfers, and price changes.Because the effect of temperature has not changed since 1969, we infer that recent uptake or innovation in adaptation measures have been limited.The non-linearity of the effect on different components of income suggest that temperature matters because it reduces the productivity of the economy's basic elements, such as workers and crops.If counties could choose daily temperatures to maximize output, rather than accepting their geographicallydetermined endowment, we estimate that annual income growth would rise by 1.7 percentage points.Applying our estimates to a distribution of ""business as usual"" climate change projections indicates that warmer daily temperatures will lower annual growth by 0.06-0.16percentage points in the United States unless populations engage in new forms of adaptation.",https://openalex.org/W1544628749,openalex

As a whole, the recent literature provides a more complete and nuanced picture of the retrospective voter as sometimes, but not always, effectively incentivizing elected officials to enhance public welfare. Leveraging examples of retrospective voting in areas other than the economy, the field is heading toward a middle ground in which voters resemble decision makers in many other domains. In many cases, a coherent logic governs voters' choices. In other instances, voters make mistakes, often in predictable ways subject to well-known psychological biases. Understanding the circumstances under which retrospective voting achieves effective democratic accountability and when it fails to do so is an important task for subsequent research. We discuss two additional issues for future exploration: a better understanding of normative benchmarks, and increased attention to the relationship between retrospective voting behavior and policy outcomes.",https://openalex.org/W2170291011,openalex

Current warming is leading to earlier snowmelt dates and longer snow‐free periods. Our hypothesis is that high‐mountain Mediterranean plants are not able to take advantage of a lengthened snow‐free period because this leads to longer drought that truncates the growing season. However, reproductive timing may somewhat mitigate these negative effects through temporal shifts. We assessed the effects of flowering phenology on the reproductive success of Silene ciliata , a Mediterranean high‐mountain plant, across an altitudinal gradient during two climatically contrasting years. The species showed a late‐flowering pattern hampering the use of snowmelt water. Plant fitness was largely explained by the elapsed time from snowmelt to onset of flowering, suggesting a selective pressure towards early flowering caused by soil moisture depletion. The proportion of flowering plants decreased at the lowest population, especially in the drier year. Plants produced more flowers, fruits and seeds at the highest population and in the mild year. Our results indicate that water deficit in dry years could threaten the lowland populations of this mountainous species, while high‐altitude environments are more stable over time.",https://openalex.org/W2013559021,openalex

Finally, I discuss the contribution of various operational approaches, including time series and counterfactual approaches for assessing causal effects and process-tracing approaches for establishing causal mechanisms. Having a coherent concept of causality, agreeing on a precise vocabulary and harnessing our tools with the clear purpose of establishing both causal effects and causal mechanisms should strengthen causal explanations for single cases, for drawing policy-relevant lessons and for theoretical development in relation to land and, more broadly, social-ecological systems processes.",https://openalex.org/W2211203886,openalex

Further, the balance between consumption, available supply, and stocks seems to be as relevant for our understanding of these markets as it was decades ago.

Kaufmann; Yuhong Tian; Ranga B. Myneni; Compton J. Tucker,2003.0,,"This paper analyzes the relation between satellite‐based measures of vegetation greenness and climate by land cover type at a regional scale (2° × 2° grid boxes) between 1982 and 1999. We use the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies (GIMMS) data set to quantify climate‐induced changes in terrestrial vegetation. Climatic conditions are represented with monthly data for land surface air temperature and precipitation. The relation between NDVI and the climate variables is represented using a quadratic specification, which is consistent with the notion of a physiological optimum. The effects of spatial heterogeneity and unobserved variables are estimated with specifications and statistical techniques that allow coefficients to vary among grid boxes. Using this methodology, we are able to estimate statistically meaningful relations between NDVI and climate during spring, summer, and autumn for forests between 40°N and 70°N in North America and Eurasia. Of the variables examined, changes in temperature account for the largest fraction of the change in NDVI between the early 1980s and the late 1990s. Changes in stratospheric aerosol optical depth and precipitation have a smaller effect, while artifacts associated with variations in solar zenith angle are negligible. These results indicate that temperature changes between the early 1980s and the late 1990s are responsible for much of the observed increase in satellite measures of northern forest greenness.",https://openalex.org/W1994936507,openalex

This study examined whether a similar association could be found in the southern United States, with different weather patterns than the previous studies, and examined the sensitivity of the results to different methods of analysis and covariate control. Data were available in Birmingham, Alabama, from August 1985 through 1988. Regression analyses controlled for weather, time trends, day of the week, and year of study and removed any long-term patterns (such as seasonal and monthly fluctuations) from the data by trigonometric filtering. A significant association was found between inhalable particles and daily mortality in Poisson regression analysis (relative risk = 1.11, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.20). The relative risk was estimated for a 100-micrograms/m3 increase in inhalable particles. Results were unchanged when least squares regression was used, when robust regression was used, and under an alternative filtering scheme. Diagnostic plots showed that the filtering successfully removed long wavelength patterns from the data. The generalized additive model, which models the expected number of deaths as nonparametric smoothed functions of the covariates, was then used to ensure adequate control for any nonlinearities in the weather dependence. Essentially identical results for inhalable particles were seen, with no evidence of a threshold down to the lowest observed exposure levels. The association also was unchanged when all days with particulate air pollution levels in excess of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards were deleted. The magnitude of the effect is consistent with recent estimates from Philadelphia, Steubenville, Detroit, Minneapolis, St. Louis, and Utah Valley.",https://openalex.org/W1909880584,openalex

Based on a recently rigorized physical notion, namely, information flow, we solve an inverse problem and give this important and challenging question, which is of interest in a wide variety of disciplines, a positive answer. Here causality is measured by the time rate of information flowing from one series to the other. The resulting formula is tight in form, involving only commonly used statistics, namely, sample covariances; an immediate corollary is that causation implies correlation, but correlation does not imply causation. It has been validated with touchstone linear and nonlinear series, purportedly generated with one-way causality that evades the traditional approaches. It has also been applied successfully to the investigation of real-world problems; an example presented here is the cause-and-effect relation between the two climate modes, El Niño and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), which have been linked to hazards in far-flung regions of the globe. In general, the two modes are mutually causal, but the causality is asymmetric: El Niño tends to stabilize IOD, while IOD functions to make El Niño more uncertain. To El Niño, the information flowing from IOD manifests itself as a propagation of uncertainty from the Indian Ocean.",https://openalex.org/W2312414574,openalex

It is predicted that such climate change will increase the severity and frequency of climate-related disasters like flash floods, surges, cyclones, and severe storms. This article uses econometric methods to study the consequences of climate-induced natural disasters on economic growth, and how these disasters are linked to the onset of armed civil conflict either directly or via their impact on economic growth. The results show that climate-related natural disasters have a negative effect on growth and that the impact is considerable. The analysis of conflict onset shows that climate-related natural disasters do not increase the risk of armed conflict. This is also true when we instrument the change in GDP growth by climatic disasters. The result is robust to inclusion of country and time fixed effects, different estimation techniques, and various operationalization of the disasters measure, as well as for conflict incidence and war onset. These findings have two major implications: if climate change increases the frequency or makes weather-related natural disasters more severe, it is an economic concern for countries susceptible to these types of hazards. However, our results suggest – based on historical data – that more frequent and severe climate-related disasters will not lead to more armed conflicts through their effects on GDP growth.",https://openalex.org/W2119227836,openalex

Stephenson; Matthew Collins; Terence C. Mills,2006.0,,"Abstract This study uses a Granger causality time series modeling approach to quantitatively diagnose the feedback of daily sea surface temperatures (SSTs) on daily values of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) as simulated by a realistic coupled general circulation model (GCM). Bivariate vector autoregressive time series models are carefully fitted to daily wintertime SST and NAO time series produced by a 50-yr simulation of the Third Hadley Centre Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere GCM (HadCM3). The approach demonstrates that there is a small yet statistically significant feedback of SSTs on the NAO. The SST tripole index is found to provide additional predictive information for the NAO than that available by using only past values of NAO—the SST tripole is Granger causal for the NAO. Careful examination of local SSTs reveals that much of this effect is due to the effect of SSTs in the region of the Gulf Steam, especially south of Cape Hatteras. The effect of SSTs on NAO is responsible for the slower-than-exponential decay in lag-autocorrelations of NAO notable at lags longer than 10 days. The persistence induced in daily NAO by SSTs causes long-term means of NAO to have more variance than expected from averaging NAO noise if there is no feedback of the ocean on the atmosphere. There are greater long-term trends in NAO than can be expected from aggregating just short-term atmospheric noise, and NAO is potentially predictable provided that future SSTs are known. For example, there is about 10%–30% more variance in seasonal wintertime means of NAO and almost 70% more variance in annual means of NAO due to SST effects than one would expect if NAO were a purely atmospheric process.",https://openalex.org/W1975049191,openalex

In order to achieve a more meaningful understanding of agency and structure in migration processes, this framework conceptualises migration as a function of aspirations and capabilities to migrate within given sets of perceived geographical opportunity structures. It distinguishes between the instrumental (means-to-an-end) and intrinsic (directly wellbeing-affecting) dimensions of human mobility. This yields a vision in which moving and staying are seen as complementary manifestations of migratory agency and in which human mobility is defined as people's capability to choose where to live, including the option to stay, rather than as the act of moving or migrating itself. Drawing on Berlin's concepts of positive and negative liberty (as manifestations of the widely varying structural conditions under which migration occurs) this paper conceptualises how macro-structural change shapes people's migratory aspirations and capabilities. The resulting framework helps to understand the complex and often counter-intuitive ways in which processes of social transformation and 'development' shape patterns of migration and enable us to integrate the analysis of almost all forms of migratory mobility within one meta-conceptual framework.",https://openalex.org/W3134083113,openalex

The Agenda 2030 highlights the importance of biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems to maintain economic activities and the well-being of local communities. Nature Based Solutions (NBS) support biodiversity conservation and the functioning of ecosystems. NBS are increasingly seen as innovative solutions to manage water-related risks while transforming natural capital into a source of green growth and sustainable development.

After testing for cross-sectional dependence, unit root and cointegration, the study estimated the pool mean group (PMG) panel autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL). The empirical outcome revealed that rainfall had a significantly positive effect on food availability, accessibility, and utilization in the long run. In contrast, temperature was harmful to food availability and accessibility and had no impact on food utilization. Lastly, CO2 emission positively impacted food availability and accessibility but did not affect food utilization. The study took a step further by integrating some additional variables and performed the panel fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) regression to ensure the robustness of the preceding PMG results. The control variables yielded meaningful results in most cases, so did the FMOLS and DOLS regression. The Granger causality test was conducted to determine the causal link, if any, among the variables. There was evidence of a short-run causal relationship between food availability and CO2 emission. Food accessibility exhibited a causal association with temperature, whereas food utilization was strongly connected with temperature. CO2 emission was linked to rainfall. Lastly, a bidirectional causal link was found between rainfall and temperature. Recommendations to the national, sub-regional, and regional policymakers are addressed and discussed.",https://openalex.org/W4206148239,openalex
A660,Estimating the mortality impacts of particulate matter: what can be learned from between-study variability?,https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.00108109,Jonathan I. Levy; James K. Hammitt; J D Spengler,2000.0,,"Epidemiologic studies of the link between particulate matter (PM) concentrations and mortality rates have yielded a range of estimates, leading to disagreement about the magnitude of the relationship and the strength of the causal connection. Previous meta-analyses of this literature have provided pooled effect estimates, but have not addressed between-study variability that may be associated with analytical models, pollution patterns, and exposed populations. To determine whether study-specific factors can explain some of the variability in the time-series studies on mortality from particulate matter [less than/equal to] 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(10)), we applied an empirical Bayes meta-analysis. We estimate that mortality rates increase on average by 0.7% per 10 microg/m(3) increase in PM(10) concentrations, with greater effects at sites with higher ratios of particulate matter [less than/equal to] 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(2.5))/PM(10). This finding did not change with the inclusion of a number of potential confounders and effect modifiers, although there is some evidence that PM effects are influenced by climate, housing characteristics, demographics, and the presence of sulfur dioxide and ozone. Although further analysis would be needed to determine which factors causally influence the relationship between PM(10) and mortality, these findings can help guide future epidemiologic investigations and policy decisions.",https://openalex.org/W2145880514,openalex

In this paper we argue that much better use should be made of the wealth of hydrological knowledge gained in the past century and that it is essential to expand the information beyond the flood sample at the site of interest. We suggest that the expansion of information can be grouped into three types: temporal, spatial, and causal. We present a number of examples from Austria to illustrate the rich diversity of flood processes that are often site specific and difficult to capture by formal methods. On the basis of these examples, and the expansion of information, we illustrate that hydrological reasoning can provide diagnostic findings that give guidance on how to adjust quantitative estimates from formal methods to more fully capture the subtleties of the flood characteristics at the site of interest. We believe that this approach gives a more complete representation of flood processes at a given site than the existing formal methods alone and propose the term “flood frequency hydrology,” as opposed to flood frequency statistics, to reflect the focus on hydrological processes and hydrological reasoning.",https://openalex.org/W1598372991,openalex

Smith; Zhnongwei Liu,2012.0,,"In this article, we present the results of a study investigating the influence of vulnerability to climate change as a function of physical vulnerability, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity on climate change risk perception. In 2008/2009, we surveyed Nevada ranchers and farmers to assess their climate change‐related beliefs, and risk perceptions, political orientations, and socioeconomic characteristics. Ranchers’ and farmers’ sensitivity to climate change was measured through estimating the proportion of their household income originating from highly scarce water‐dependent agriculture to the total income. Adaptive capacity was measured as a combination of the Social Status Index and the Poverty Index. Utilizing water availability and use, and population distribution GIS databases; we assessed water resource vulnerability in Nevada by zip code as an indicator of physical vulnerability to climate change. We performed correlation tests and multiple regression analyses to examine the impact of vulnerability and its three distinct components on risk perception. We find that vulnerability is not a significant determinant of risk perception. Physical vulnerability alone also does not impact risk perception. Both sensitivity and adaptive capacity increase risk perception. While age is not a significant determinant of it, gender plays an important role in shaping risk perception. Yet, general beliefs such as political orientations and climate change‐specific beliefs such as believing in the anthropogenic causes of climate change and connecting the locally observed impacts (in this case drought) to climate change are the most prominent determinants of risk perception.",https://openalex.org/W2144653265,openalex

Hierarchical linear models were used to examine this hypothesis across 2 weeks of daily activity and well-being reports controlling for trait-level individual differences. Results strongly supported the hypothesis. The authors also examined the social activities that contribute to satisfaction of relatedness needs. The best predictors were meaningful talk and feeling understood and appreciated by interaction partners.

This paper evaluates the economic implications of eradication of Malaria, Dengue, Yellow Fever and Ebola on the affected destination countries focusing on the tourist expenditures. A gravity model for international tourism flows is used to provide an estimation of the impact of each travel-related disease on international tourist arrivals. Next the potential eradication of these diseases in the affected countries is simulated and the impact on tourism expenditures is estimated. The results show that, in the case of Malaria, Dengue, Yellow Fever and Ebola, the eradication of these diseases in the affected countries would result in an increase of around 10 million of tourist worldwide and a rise in the tourism expenditure of 12 billion dollars. By analysing the economic benefits of the eradication of Dengue, Ebola, Malaria, and Yellow Fever for the tourist sector-a strategic economic sector for many of the countries where these TRD are present-this paper explores a new aspect of the quantification of health policies which should be taken into consideration in future international health assessment programmes. It is important to note that the analysis is only made of the direct impact of the diseases' eradication and consequently the potential multiplicative effects of a growth in the GDP, in terms of tourism attractiveness, are not evaluated. Consequently, the economic results can be considered to be skeleton ones.",https://openalex.org/W2577310482,openalex

Determinants are positioned at the individual and/or couple level (micro-level), social relationships and social networks (meso-level); and, by cultural and institutional settings (macro-level). The focus is both on the quantum and on the tempo of fertility, with a particular focus on the postponement of childbearing.

These challenges include depletion of natural resources, globalization challenges, and environmental degradation. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economies are rich in mineral resources. Economic globalization has put the MENA countries in the spotlight for the developed world. Despite the status of being a hotspot for mineral resource richness, there is limited research on the effect of natural resources and economic globalization on the environmental degradation of the MENA countries. This paper examines the effects of natural resource abundance and economic globalization on environmental quality by considering trade openness, urbanization, and economic growth from the year 1980 to 2018. We apply second‐generation panel cointegration techniques along with continuously updated fully modified (Cup‐FM) and continuously updated bias‐corrected (Cup‐BC) techniques. The findings show that natural resource abundance significantly improves environmental quality. Likewise, economic globalization also mitigates emissions levels in the MENA countries. In contrast, trade openness, urbanization, and economic growth significantly deteriorate environmental quality. The unidirectional link indicates natural resources and economic globalization create trade openness.

One goal of this paper is to provide an accessible introduction to causal discovery methods for climate scientists, with a focus on constraint-based structure learning. Second, in a detailed case study constraint-based structure learning is applied to derive hypotheses of causal relationships between four prominent modes of atmospheric low-frequency variability in boreal winter including the Western Pacific Oscillation (WPO), Eastern Pacific Oscillation (EPO), Pacific–North America (PNA) pattern, and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The results are shown in the form of static and temporal independence graphs also known as Bayesian Networks. It is found that WPO and EPO are nearly indistinguishable from the cause–effect perspective as strong simultaneous coupling is identified between the two. In addition, changes in the state of EPO (NAO) may cause changes in the state of NAO (PNA) approximately 18 (3–6) days later. These results are not only consistent with previous findings on dynamical processes connecting different low-frequency modes (e.g., interaction between synoptic and low-frequency eddies) but also provide the basis for formulating new hypotheses regarding the time scale and temporal sequencing of dynamical processes responsible for these connections. Last, the authors propose to use structure learning for climate networks, which are currently based primarily on correlation analysis. While correlation-based climate networks focus on similarity between nodes, independence graphs would provide an alternative viewpoint by focusing on information flow in the network.",https://openalex.org/W2071312622,openalex

We show that an already marginalized group—female-headed households in South Africa—is differentially affected by relatively modest levels of variation in rainfall, which households experience on a year-to-year basis. Data from three waves of the National Income Dynamics Survey in South Africa allow us to follow incomes of 4,162 households from 2006 to 2012. By observing how household income is affected by variation in rainfall relative to what is normally experienced during the rainy season in each district, our study employs a series of naturally occurring experiments that allow us to identify causal effects. We find that households where a single head can be identified based on residency or work status are more vulnerable to climate variability than households headed by two adults. Single male-headed households are more vulnerable because of lower initial earnings and, to a lesser extent, other household characteristics that contribute to economic disadvantages. However, this can only explain some of the differential vulnerability of female-headed households. This suggests that there are traits specific to female-headed households, such as limited access to protective social networks or other coping strategies, which makes this an important dimension of marginalization to consider for further research and policy in South Africa and other national contexts. Households headed by widows, never-married women, and women with a non-resident spouse (e.g., “left-behind” migrant households) are particularly vulnerable. We find vulnerable households only in districts where rainfall has a large effect on agricultural yields, and female-headed households remain vulnerable when accounting for dynamic impacts of rainfall on income.",https://openalex.org/W2523370331,openalex

Treating hearing loss with hearing aids may ameliorate cognitive decline. The purpose of this study was to test whether use of hearing aids was associated with better cognitive performance, and if this relationship was mediated via social isolation and/or depression. Structural equation modelling of associations between hearing loss, cognitive performance, social isolation, depression and hearing aid use was carried out with a subsample of the UK Biobank data set (n = 164,770) of UK adults aged 40 to 69 years who completed a hearing test. Age, sex, general health and socioeconomic status were controlled for as potential confounders. Hearing aid use was associated with better cognition, independently of social isolation and depression. This finding was consistent with the hypothesis that hearing aids may improve cognitive performance, although if hearing aids do have a positive effect on cognition it is not likely to be via reduction of the adverse effects of hearing loss on social isolation or depression. We suggest that any positive effects of hearing aid use on cognition may be via improvement in audibility or associated increases in self-efficacy. Alternatively, positive associations between hearing aid use and cognition may be accounted for by more cognitively able people seeking and using hearing aids. Further research is required to determine the direction of association, if there is any direct causal relationship between hearing aid use and better cognition, and whether hearing aid use results in reduction in rates of cognitive decline measured longitudinally.",https://openalex.org/W2099623128,openalex

The runaway winner of the duel is natural amenity led growth with the crown going to Graves. Implications are drawn for both empirical research and EU economic integration. Resumen La nueva geografía económica (NEG, siglas en inglés) se ha convertido en un pilar de las ciencias regionales de las dos últimas décadas, ratificado por el Premio Nobel otorgado a Paul Krugman. A pesar de ello, la mayoría de científicos y economistas de ciencias urbanas/regionales no utilizan la NEG para determinar patrones de crecimiento regionales. En su lugar, se apoyan en factores tales como la migración natural por recreo, cuyas raíces se sustentan en el trabajo de Philip Graves de mediados de los 70. Por el contrario, dos de los líderes en geografía económica – Allen Scott y Michael Storper – han defendido enérgicamente que es la disponibilidad de empleos, y no la calidad de vida familiar, la que ha determinado las dinámicas regionales en los EE.UU. Dada la disparidad de opiniones acerca de la economía más desarrollada del mundo, organizamos un torneo para determinar cuáles de estos contendientes importantes son capaces de predecir la dinámica de crecimiento interregional en los EE.UU. durante los últimos 40–60 años. La victoria abrumadora del torneo es para el crecimiento motivado por recreo público natural, con los laureles para Graves. Formulamos implicaciones tanto para estudios empíricos como para la integración económica con la UE.",https://openalex.org/W2105259738,openalex

This does not only challenge scientific progress, but also raises the question of whether they measure one identical concept with different methods or whether they measure different understandings of resilience. This paper provides a review of concepts, methodological approaches and empirical evidence on resilience from a food security perspective, focusing on socio-economic research. We perform a systematic literature search to identify recent publications that analyze resilience from the perspective of household food security. We examine the historical evolution of concepts and methods used for measuring resilience and synthesize the evidence. We find that conceptual and analytical models have evolved over time, with important technical adjustments. Studies initially focused on measuring resilience as an end in itself, but more recently resilience is understood as a means to an ultimate end, hence resilience capacity is measured instead. Also, resilience was initially measured as an indicator of food security. Currently it is measured distinctly from food security. Multivariate techniques are found to be frequently used to quantify resilience. The empirical evidence suggests that households with higher resilience capacity tend to have less child malnutrition and better food security. We find that causal pathways through which resilience capacity affects food security in a microeconomic framework are barely explicitly considered in empirical analyses. Therefore, we suggest a model which explicitly addresses these pathways.",https://openalex.org/W2970759669,openalex

Bradley; Michelle Ellul,2014.0,,"Individuals' direct exposure to and experience of climate change are arguably integral aspects of their risk perceptions, understandings, and engagement with the issue. Recent research investigating these experiences has thrown into sharp relief some fundamental considerations with respect to public risk perceptions and responses, in particular the extent to which such perceived encounters might reflect a priori beliefs and motivated reasoning. Findings to date are intriguing and compelling, both in regard to the escalating percentages of individuals who report having such personal encounters, and conclusions being drawn with respect to the nature, significance, and influence of such direct experience. These findings have also led to some intuitively reasonable but possibly problematic recommendations regarding policy and issue and behavioural engagement implications. A focus on underlying processes of experience and belief, oversimplified in terms of ‘seeing’ or ‘believing’, has however deflected attention from other issues such as the nature and contexts of individual climate change encounters, the clarity of the constructs and validity of the measures being used for ‘belief’ and ‘experience’, and the transactional and phenomenological nature of climate change encounters. There is nonetheless current and convergent evidence that perceived direct experience of environmental changes or events deemed to be manifestations of climate change influences psychological responses such as risk perception, acceptance, belief certainty, distress, and psychological and behavioural adaptation. These findings suggest that such experiences, for many, foster a contextualized and more personally meaningful realisation of what climate change portends, implies, and ultimately means, locally and globally.

Samet; Scott L. Zeger,2000.0,,"Summary Reports over the last decade of association between levels of particles in outdoor air and daily mortality counts have raised concern that air pollution shortens life, even at concentrations within current regulatory limits. Criticisms of these reports have focused on the statistical techniques that are used to estimate the pollution–mortality relationship and the inconsistency in findings between cities. We have developed analytical methods that address these concerns and combine evidence from multiple locations to gain a unified analysis of the data. The paper presents log-linear regression analyses of daily time series data from the largest 20 US cities and introduces hierarchical regression models for combining estimates of the pollution–mortality relationship across cities. We illustrate this method by focusing on mortality effects of PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter) and by performing univariate and bivariate analyses with PM10 and ozone (O3) level. In the first stage of the hierarchical model, we estimate the relative mortality rate associated with PM10 for each of the 20 cities by using semiparametric log-linear models. The second stage of the model describes between-city variation in the true relative rates as a function of selected city-specific covariates. We also fit two variations of a spatial model with the goal of exploring the spatial correlation of the pollutant-specific coefficients among cities. Finally, to explore the results of considering the two pollutants jointly, we fit and compare univariate and bivariate models. All posterior distributions from the second stage are estimated by using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. In univariate analyses using concurrent day pollution values to predict mortality, we find that an increase of 10 μg m-3 in PM10 on average in the USA is associated with a 0.48% increase in mortality (95% interval: 0.05, 0.92). With adjustment for the O3 level the PM10-coefficient is slightly higher. The results are largely insensitive to the specific choice of vague but proper prior distribution. The models and estimation methods are general and can be used for any number of locations and pollutant measurements and have potential applications to other environmental agents.",https://openalex.org/W2046863970,openalex

Camerer; George Loewenstein; Dražen Prelec,2005.0,,"Neuroeconomics uses knowledge about brain mechanisms to inform economic analysis, and roots economics in biology. It opens up the “black box” of the brain, much as organizational economics adds detail to the theory of the firm. Neuroscientists use many tools— including brain imaging, behavior of patients with localized brain lesions, animal behavior, and recording single neuron activity. The key insight for economics is that the brain is composed of multiple systems which interact. Controlled systems (“executive function”) interrupt automatic ones. Emotions and cognition both guide decisions. Just as prices and allocations emerge from the interaction of two processes—supply and demand— individual decisions can be modeled as the result of two (or more) processes interacting. Indeed, “dual-process” models of this sort are better rooted in neuroscientific fact, and more empirically accurate, than single-process models (such as utility-maximization). We discuss how brain evidence complicates standard assumptions about basic preference, to include homeostasis and other kinds of state-dependence. We also discuss applications to intertemporal choice, risk and decision making, and game theory. Intertemporal choice appears to be domain-specific and heavily influenced by emotion. The simplified ß-d of quasi-hyperbolic discounting is supported by activation in distinct regions of limbic and cortical systems. In risky decision, imaging data tentatively support the idea that gains and losses are coded separately, and that ambiguity is distinct from risk, because it activates fear and discomfort regions. (Ironically, lesion patients who do not receive fear signals in prefrontal cortex are “rationally” neutral toward ambiguity.) Game theory studies show the effect of brain regions implicated in “theory of mind”, correlates of strategic skill, and effects of hormones and other biological variables. Finally, economics can contribute to neuroscience because simple rational-choice models are useful for understanding highly-evolved behavior like motor actions that earn rewards, and Bayesian integration of sensorimotor information. Who knows what I want to do? Who knows what anyone wants to do? How can you be sure about something like that? Isn't it all a question of brain chemistry, signals going back and forth, electrical energy in the cortex? How do you know whether something is really what you want to do or just some kind of nerve impulse in the brain. Some minor little activity takes place somewhere in this unimportant place in one of the brain hemispheres and suddenly I want to go to Montana or I don't want to go to Montana.

We propose an alternative, data centric, approach that relies on actual measurements of climate observations and human and natural forcing factors. Specifically, we develop a novel method to infer causality from spatial-temporal data, as well as a procedure to incorporate extreme value modeling into our method in order to address the attribution of extreme climate events, such as heatwaves. Our experimental results on a real world dataset indicate that changes in temperature are not solely accounted for by solar radiance, but attributed more significantly to CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Combined with extreme value modeling, we also show that there has been a significant increase in the intensity of extreme temperatures, and that such changes in extreme temperature are also attributable to greenhouse gases. These preliminary results suggest that our approach can offer a useful alternative to the simulation-based approach to climate modeling and attribution, and provide valuable insights from a fresh perspective.",https://openalex.org/W2051148835,openalex

Compas,1987.0,,"In this article, research on how children and adolescents cope with stress and coping's role in reducing the adverse psychological states associated with stress is reviewed. Child and adolescent coping is reflected in seven different lines of research—infa nts' responses to maternal separation, social support, interpersonal cognitive problem-solving, coping in achievement contexts, Type A behavior pattern in children, repression-sensitization, and resilience to stress. A variety of different coping resources, styles, and specific strategies are important in successfully adapting to stress, including efforts that focus directly on the problem, as well as attempts to deal with adverse emotions associated with stress. Directions for future research are identified, emphasizing the need for more systematic comparisons of coping across different types of stress and over time in response to a single stressful episode. A central feature of human development involves coping with psychosocial stress. Beginning in infancy, individuals are confronted with a stream of potentially threatening and challenging situations that require action and adaptation. The modest to moderate correlations typically found between stressful life events and disorder during childhood and adolescence suggest that individual difference factors related to coping may moderate the stress-disorder relation (see Compas, in press, for a review). The resources available to cope with stress and the manner in which individuals actually cope may be important factors influencing patterns of positive growth and development as opposed to the onset of a host of psychological and somatic problems. Although the study of coping with stress during adulthood has been characterized by increasing convergence in conceptualization and measurement (e.g., Lazarus & Folkman, 1984; Menaghan, 1983; Moos & Billings, 1982), this is not true for coping during childhood and adolescence. Instead, coping in younger age groups has been represented by different definitions and methods of measurement, as well as several divergent lines of research. The purpose of this review is to integrate these somewhat disparate areas of research and to identify future directions for study. First, various definitions and conceptualizations of coping are discussed. Second, empirical studies of coping during childhood and adolescence are reviewed. Finally, conclusions drawn from this research, the major issues facing the field, and directions for future research are outlined.",https://openalex.org/W2016118916,openalex

Pumphrey,2008.0,,"Abstract : 1 INTRODUCTION Carolyn Pumphrey Triangle Institute for Security Studies The Evolution of a Problem. Until fairly recent times no one thought climate changed, let alone was influenced by human activities. By the 19th century, scientists were theorizing that temperatures were affected by what we now call greenhouse gasses. And in the late 19th century, the Swedish scientist Arrhenius suggested that human industry might cause the planet to warm. But this notion was generally scoffed at. Over the course of the 20th century, the scientific community gradually came to terms with this theory and began to regard climate change even rapid climate change as more than a distant possibility. Interest in climate change as a national security issue developed even later. Although the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) did commission a study to look into the security implications of climate change in the late 1970s, the issue had little resonance until the late 1990s when the Senate Armed Services Committee declared that environmental destruction, including global warming, was a growing national security threat. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was created in 1995 in part to allay fears. And then, in 2003, the rather notorious report commissioned by the Pentagon, An Abrupt Climate Change Scenario and its Implications for United States National Security, provided a worst-case scenario, which suggested that climate change might have a catastrophic impact, leading to rioting and nuclear war.",https://openalex.org/W241766827,openalex

Bretherton,2019.0,,"Abstract General circulation models (GCMs) typically have a grid size of 25–200 km. Parametrizations are used to represent diabatic processes such as radiative transfer and cloud microphysics and account for subgrid‐scale motions and variability. Unlike traditional approaches, neural networks (NNs) can readily exploit recent observational data sets and global cloud‐system resolving model (CRM) simulations to learn subgrid variability. This article describes an NN parametrization trained by coarse‐graining a near‐global CRM simulation with a 4‐km horizontal grid spacing. The NN predicts the residual heating and moistening averaged over (160 km) 2 grid boxes as a function of the coarse‐resolution fields within the same atmospheric column. This NN is coupled to the dynamical core of a GCM with the same 160‐km resolution. A recent study described how to train such an NN to be stable when coupled to specified time‐evolving advective forcings in a single‐column model, but feedbacks between NN and GCM components cause spatially extended simulations to crash within a few days. Analyzing the linearized response of such an NN reveals that it learns to exploit a strong synchrony between precipitation and the atmospheric state above 10 km. Removing these variables from the NN's inputs stabilizes the coupled simulations, which predict the future state more accurately than a coarse‐resolution simulation without any parametrizations of subgrid‐scale variability, although the mean state slowly drifts.",https://openalex.org/W3100642145,openalex

To examine potential confounding by other pollutants, I regressed city- and season-specific effect sizes against the relationship between airborne particles and other pollutants. Controlling for other pollutants did not substantially (or significantly) change the estimated effect of airborne particles. Socioeconomic differences between cities likewise did not modify the effect. The increase in daily deaths that occurred out of hospitals (0.89% per 10 microg/m(3); CI, 0.67-1.10%) was substantially greater than the increase in deaths in hospitals (0. 49%; CI, 0.31-0.68%).

Furthermore, previous researchers have not found an experimental treatment effect on adult economic self‐sufficiency, relative to controls.

The primary objective of this study was to determine the metabolic consequences and community prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing in mildly obese, but otherwise healthy, individuals. One hundred and fifty healthy men, without diabetes or cardiopulmonary disease, were recruited from the community. Measurements included polysomnography, a multiple sleep latency test, an oral glucose tolerance test, determination of body fat by hydrodensitometry, and fasting insulin and lipids. The prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing, depending on the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) cutoff, ranged from 40 to 60%. After adjusting for body mass index (BMI) and percent body fat, an AHI ⩾ 5 events/h was associated with an increased risk of having impaired or diabetic glucose tolerance (odds ratio, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.05–4.38). The impairment in glucose tolerance was related to the severity of oxygen desaturation ( Δ SaO2 ) associated with sleep-disordered breathing. For a 4% decrease in oxygen saturation, the associated odds ratio for worsening glucose tolerance was 1.99 (95% CI, 1.11 to 3.56) after adjusting for percent body fat, BMI, and AHI. Multivariable linear regression analyses revealed that increasing AHI was associated with worsening insulin resistance independent of obesity. Thus, sleep-disordered breathing is a prevalent condition in mildly obese men and is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance.",https://openalex.org/W2063135200,openalex

Burton; Samuel Rufat; Eric Tate,2018.0,,"In recent years there has been growing recognition that disaster risk cannot be reduced by focusing solely on physical hazards without considering factors that influence socio-economic impact. Vulnerability: the susceptibility to the damaging impacts of hazards, and resilience: the ability to recover, have become popular concepts in natural hazard and risk management. This book provides a comprehensive overview of the concepts of vulnerability and resilience and their application to natural hazards research. With contributions from both physical and social scientists it provides an interdisciplinary discussion of the different types of vulnerability and resilience, the links between them, and concludes with the remaining challenges and future directions of the field. Examining global case studies from the US coast to Austria, this is a valuable reference for researchers and graduate students working in natural hazard and risk reduction from both the natural and social sciences.",https://openalex.org/W2953276334,openalex

A725,Constraining the aerosol influence on cloud fraction,https://doi.org/10.1002/2015jd023744,Edward Gryspeerdt; Johannes Quaas; Nicolas Bellouin,2016.0,,"Abstract Aerosol‐cloud interactions have the potential to modify many different cloud properties. There is significant uncertainty in the strength of these aerosol‐cloud interactions in analyses of observational data, partly due to the difficulty in separating aerosol effects on clouds from correlations generated by local meteorology. The relationship between aerosol and cloud fraction (CF) is particularly important to determine, due to the strong correlation of CF to other cloud properties and its large impact on radiation. It has also been one of the hardest to quantify from satellites due to the strong meteorological covariations involved. This work presents a new method to analyze the relationship between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and CF. By including information about the cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), the impact of the meteorological covariations is significantly reduced. This method shows that much of the AOD‐CF correlation is explained by relationships other than that mediated by CDNC. By accounting for these, the strength of the global mean AOD‐CF relationship is reduced by around 80%. This suggests that the majority of the AOD‐CF relationship is due to meteorological covariations, especially in the shallow cumulus regime. Requiring CDNC to mediate the AOD‐CF relationship implies an effective anthropogenic radiative forcing from an aerosol influence on liquid CF of −0.48 W m −2 (−0.1 to −0.64 W m −2 ), although some uncertainty remains due to possible biases in the CDNC retrievals in broken cloud scenes.",https://openalex.org/W2299943051,openalex

Rosier,2020.0,,"Abstract Hurricane Harvey is one of the costliest tropical cyclones in history. In this paper, we use a probabilistic event attribution framework to estimate the costs associated with Hurricane Harvey that are attributable to anthropogenic influence on the climate system. Results indicate that the “fraction of attributable risk” for the rainfall from Harvey was likely about at least a third with a preferable/best estimate of three quarters. With an average estimate of damages from Harvey assessed at about US$90bn, applying this fraction gives a best estimate of US$67bn, with a likely lower bound of at least US$30bn, of these damages that are attributable to the human influence on climate. This “bottom-up” event-based estimate of climate change damages contrasts sharply with the more “top-down” approach using integrated assessment models (IAMs) or global macroeconometric estimates: one IAM estimates annual climate change damages in the USA to be in the region of US$21.3bn. While the two approaches are not easily comparable, it is noteworthy that our “bottom-up” results estimate that one single extreme weather event contributes more to climate change damages in the USA than an entire year by the “top-down” method. Given that the “top-down” approach, at best, parameterizes but does not resolve the effects of extreme weather events, our findings suggest that the “bottom-up” approach is a useful avenue to pursue in future attempts to refine estimates of climate change damages.",https://openalex.org/W3016076986,openalex

Changes in atmosphere and/or landscape characteristics modify the earth's metabolism through changes in its biogeochemical cycles. The most basic of these is the water cycle which directly affects the global circulation of both atmosphere and ocean and hence is instrumental in shaping weather and climate. Defining the spatial extent of the environmental impact of a local land surface change, or identifying, for forecasting purposes, the location and nature of climatic anomalies that may be causally linked to local hydrologic persistencies requires global scale dynamic modeling of the coupled ocean‐atmosphere‐land surface. Development, evaluation, verification, and use of these models requires the active participation of hydrologists along with a wide range of other earth scientists.

Marqués; Alejandro Ribeiro,2019.0,,"Network topology inference is a prominent problem in Network Science. Most graph signal processing (GSP) efforts to date assume that the underlying network is known, and then analyze how the graph's algebraic and spectral characteristics impact the properties of the graph signals of interest. Such an assumption is often untenable beyond applications dealing with e.g., directly observable social and infrastructure networks; and typically adopted graph construction schemes are largely informal, distinctly lacking an element of validation. This tutorial offers an overview of graph learning methods developed to bridge the aforementioned gap, by using information available from graph signals to infer the underlying graph topology. Fairly mature statistical approaches are surveyed first, where correlation analysis takes center stage along with its connections to covariance selection and high-dimensional regression for learning Gaussian graphical models. Recent GSP-based network inference frameworks are also described, which postulate that the network exists as a latent underlying structure, and that observations are generated as a result of a network process defined in such a graph. A number of arguably more nascent topics are also briefly outlined, including inference of dynamic networks, nonlinear models of pairwise interaction, as well as extensions to directed graphs and their relation to causal inference. All in all, this paper introduces readers to challenges and opportunities for signal processing research in emerging topic areas at the crossroads of modeling, prediction, and control of complex behavior arising in networked systems that evolve over time.",https://openalex.org/W2994097903,openalex

Despite the human origin of most of these fires, little is known of how environmental and socioeconomic variables contribute to the spatial patterns of fire incidence and burned areas. The tropical Mexican State of Chiapas represents a good case study to analyze these interactions, due to the availability of official data, and its similarities to other tropical countries, in terms of environmental and socioeconomic characteristics. This study evaluates the relative importance of human-related and environmental variables in determining the distribution of the number of fires and area burned in the tropical State of Chiapas in years of normal and extreme climatic conditions (non-El Niño vs. El Niño). We have searched for causal relationships among fire, environmental, and socioeconomic variables in Chiapas using path analysis. Results of this study show a major importance of environmental variables in non-El Niño years, suggesting that the status of the vegetation was the main cause determining fire ignition and fire spread in these years. Contrarily, the observed trends in the El Niño period indicate that fire trends were mainly determined by the presence of ignition agents. In these El Niño years, vegetation is so severely water stressed that, when fire starts, all vegetation types burn, regardless of their flammability properties. The main vegetation types affected by fire in non-El Niño years were the most flammable ones, such as pine–oak communities, while rainforests burned the most in El Niño years. Altitude, pine–oak communities, and poverty levels played major roles in the arboreal fire incidence in non-El Niño years, whereas the distribution of pastures appeared as an important variable determining arboreal fire incidence in El Niño years. When all fires were considered (affecting any vegetation layer), almost identical trends were observed, with the incorporation of a new variable influencing the area burned: density of infrastructure. The results of this study strengthen the importance of El Niño years in the conservation of rainforest ecosystems and suggest the existence of synergistic effects involving fires, fragmentation, and certain elements of the landscape, such as cattle pastures, in tropical areas.",https://openalex.org/W2115105088,openalex

To address the potential variability of the responses of alpine ecosystems to climate change, we examined daily CO 2 exchange in relation to major environmental variables. A dataset was obtained from an alpine meadow on the Qinghai‐Tibetan Plateau from eddy covariance measurements taken over 3 years (2002–2004). Path analysis showed that soil temperature at 5 cm depth ( T s5 ) had the greatest effect on daily variation in ecosystem CO 2 exchange all year around, whereas photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) had a high direct effect on daily variation in CO 2 flux during the growing season. The combined effects of temperature and light regimes on net ecosystem CO 2 exchange (NEE) could be clearly categorized into three areas depending on the change in T s5 : (1) almost no NEE change irrespective of variations in light and temperature when T s5 was below 0 °C; (2) an NEE increase (i.e. CO 2 released from the ecosystem) with increasing T s5 , but little response to variation in light regime when 0 °C≤ T s5 ≤8 °C; and (3) an NEE decrease with increase in T s5 and PPFD when T s5 was approximately &gt;8 °C. The highest daily net ecosystem CO 2 uptake was observed under the conditions of daily mean T s5 of about 15 °C and daily mean PPFD of about 50 mol m −2 day −1 .

This social geology marks an ascendance to inhuman planetary power fuelled by fossil fuels from the Carboniferous. Yet nowhere are the geophysical, genomic, and social narratives of this geologic subjectification considered together to interrogate these geologic capacities, not just in terms of impacts on the Earth, but as forces that subjects share—geologic forces that compose and differentiate corporeal and collective biopolitical formations. I argue in this paper that the concept of the Anthropocene is axiomatic of new understandings of time, matter, and agency for the human as a collective being and as a subject capable of geomorphic acts; a being that not just affects geology, but is an intemperate force within it. This immersion of humanity into geologic time suggests both a remineralisation of the origins of the human and a shift in the human timescale from biological life course to that of epoch and species—life. The paper is structured as a modest conversation between two fossilised subjects that define the imagined origin and ending of the narrative arc of the Anthropocene—one from the prehistory of human origins, the other from the future of the Anthropocene—in a conversation about time, geology, and inhuman becomings. Examining fossils as material and discursive knots in the narrative arc of human becoming, I argue for a ‘geological turn’ that takes seriously not just our biological (or biopolitical) life, but also our geological (or geopolitical) life and its forms of differentiation. Fossils unlock this life—death, time—untimely, corporeal—incorporeal equation, suggesting the need for a theory of the geologic and a reckoning with the forces of mute matter in lively bodies: a corporeality that is driven by inhuman forces. This paper investigates what I am calling “geologic life”—a mineralogical dimension of human composition that remains currently undertheorised in social thought and is directly relevant for the material, temporal, and corporeal conceptualisation of fossil fuels. This geologic life prompts a need to rethink the coherency of the human as a territorialising force of the Earth in its prehistoric, contemporary, and future-orientated incarnation. As such, this paper proposes a speculative theoretical framework for thinking modes of geologic life within the Anthropocene.",https://openalex.org/W2022317275,openalex

Ford,1998.0,,"Although ""mental models"" are of central importance to system dynamics research and practice, the field has yet to develop an unambiguous and agreed upon definition of them. To begin to address this problem, existing definitions and descriptions of mental models in system dynamics and several literatures related to cognitive science were reviewed and compared. Available definitions were found to be overly brief, general, and vague, and different authors were found to markedly disagree on the basic characteristics of mental models. Based on this review, we concluded that in order to reduce the amount of confusion in the literature, the mental models concept should be ""unbundled"" and the term ""mental models"" should be used more narrowly. To initiate a dialogue through which the system dynamics community might achieve a shared understanding of mental models, we propose a new definition of ""mental models of dynamic systems"" accompanied by an extended annotation that explains the definitional choices made and suggests terms for other cognitive structures left undefined by narrowing the mental model concept. Suggestions for future research that could improve the field's ability to further define mental models are discussed. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",https://openalex.org/W2100650984,openalex

We investigated relationships between VRs and IA in California elementary schools over two school years in 162 3rd-5th-grade classrooms in 28 schools in three school districts: South Coast (SC), Bay Area (BA), and Central Valley (CV). We estimated relationships between daily IA and VR (estimated from two year daily real-time carbon dioxide in each classroom) in zero-inflated negative binomial models. We also compared IA benefits and energy costs of increased VRs. All school districts had median VRs below the 7.1 l/s-person California standard. For each additional 1 l/s-person of VR, IA was reduced significantly (p<0.05) in models for combined districts (-1.6%) and for SC (-1.2%), and nonsignificantly for districts providing less data: BA (-1.5%) and CV (-1.0%). Assuming associations were causal and generalizable, increasing classroom VRs from the California average (4 l/s-person) to the State standard would decrease IA by 3.4%, increase attendance-linked funding to schools by $33 million annually, and increase costs by only $4 million. Further increasing VRs would provide additional benefits.

We first provide a historical context for quantitative single hazard and multi-hazard assessment. We then construct a literature database with 146 references related to multi-hazard interrelations. We use our literature database to identify trends for hazard interrelation and multi-hazard and from these group hazard interrelations into five types: triggering, change condition, compound, independence and mutually exclusive. Our critical review identifies 19 different modelling methods to quantify natural hazard interrelationships which we cluster into three broad modelling approaches: stochastic, empirical, and mechanistic. We then synthesize results of our classification of quantification methods for hazard interrelationships and using two matrices illustrate this in practice for 24 different interrelations between 14 natural hazards, one for cascading hazards (temporal order in the multi-hazard event) and one for compound hazards (two or more hazards acting together). Finally, we provide examples of applications for each the three quantitative modelling approaches defined.

Crooks,2012.0,,"Abstract Food security occurs when all members of a household have reliable access to food in sufficient quantity and quality to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle. Given the important biological and social value of food for humans, food and food sufficiency have been traditional topics of study among biological anthropologists. The focus on food insecurity, however, has emerged within the past two decades and recent global events, including the food crisis of 2007/2008, have led to renewed interests in the topic of food insecurity and wellbeing. Here, we review current and novel threats to food security, current thinking on measurement and definitions, and then outline a model that links food insecurity to coping strategies and then to health outcomes. We suggest that coping strategies are typically context‐specific and can be food and nonfood based. We further suggest that coping strategies may impact health quite broadly, not just through nutritional pathways. We then review available data on the relationship between food insecurity and nutritional status, chronic diseases, infectious diseases, and mental health. Our review highlights the far reaching consequences of food insecurity for human wellbeing but also the considerable variability in its effect and our limited empirical knowledge of the pathways through which food insecurity impacts health. We conclude by offering thoughts on how biological anthropologists might contribute to growing our understanding of food insecurity and human health and wellbeing.

Studies exploring the phenomenology of mind wandering highlight the importance of its content and relation to meta-cognition in determining its functional outcomes. Examination of the information-processing demands of the mind-wandering state suggests that it involves perceptual decoupling to escape the constraints of the moment, its content arises from episodic and affective processes, and its regulation relies on executive control. Mind wandering also involves a complex balance of costs and benefits: Its association with various kinds of error underlines its cost, whereas its relationship to creativity and future planning suggest its potential value.

The question at the core is whether or not we want to quit energy consumption? The obvious answer to this question is “no.” Therefore, the necessity for innovation is curial to attain green energy and sustainable growth. This research specifically focused on Colombia, which represents the aforementioned threats to a large extent as the trajectory of economic expansion is characterized by significant CO 2 emissions in Colombia. In this regard, we examine the association between globalization, renewable energy, natural resources rent, economic growth, and CO 2 emissions from 1970 to 2017. The cointegration test confirmed a long association between the considered variables. This study employed the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares, Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares, and Autoregressive Distributed Lag estimators for the long-run analysis. The long-run empirical results uncovered growth-induced emissions in Colombia. The result illustrated that the path of development is unsustainable in Columbia. In contrast, globalization and renewable energy demonstrated a favorable contribution to environmental quality. The outcomes of the Gradual Shift Causality indicated that globalization, natural resource rent, and economic growth Granger cause CO 2 emissions.

On the supply side, inadequate investments in maintenance result in high technical losses; most state-owned utilities operate at a loss; and power trade, which could significantly lower the cost of electricity, is underdeveloped. On the demand side, the uptake and willingness to pay are often low in many communities, and the consumption levels of those who are connected are limited. Increased uptake and consumption of electricity will encourage investment to improve service reliability and close the access gap. Electricity Access in Sub-Saharan Africa shows that the fundamental problem is poverty and lack of economic opportunities rather than power. The solution lies in understanding that the overarching reasons for the unrealized potential involve tightly intertwined technical, financial, political, and geographic factors. The ultimate goal is to enable households and businesses to gain access to electricity and afford its use, and utilities to recover their cost and make profits. The report makes the case that policy makers need to adopt a more comprehensive and long-term approach to electrification in the region—one centered on the productive use of electricity at affordable rates. Such an approach includes increased public and private investment in infrastructure, expanded access to credit for new businesses, improved access to markets, and additional skills development to translate the potential of expanded and reliable electricity access into substantial economic impact. Enhancing the economic capabilities of communities is the best way to achieve faster and more sustainable development progress while addressing the broad challenges of affordability, low consumption, and financial viability of utilities, as well as ensuring equitable provision between urban and rural areas.",https://openalex.org/W2922469213,openalex

Stedman,2004.0,,"This article examines factors that predict perceptions of risk associated with global climate change. The research focuses on the perceptions of those associated with climate change policy making in the prairie region of Canada. The data are from an online survey ( n = 851) of those policy actors. The analysis integrates several dominant approaches to the study of risk perception: psychometric approaches that examine the effects of cognitive structure; demographic assessments that examine, for example, differences in perception based on gender or family status; and political approaches that suggest that one's position in the policy process may affect his or her perceived risk. Attitudes toward climate change are to a degree predicted by all of these factors, but only when indirect effects are observed. Sociodemographic characteristics have little direct effect on perceived risk, but do affect general beliefs that affect risk perceptions. Perceived risk is related more strongly to these general beliefs or world views than to more specific beliefs about the effects of climate change on weather patterns. Position within the policy process also contributes to our understanding of perceptions, with industry and governmental actors demonstrating similar attitudes, which contrast with environmental groups and university researchers.",https://openalex.org/W2119976381,openalex

Porter,2018.0,,"We construct a publicly available atlas of children's outcomes in adulthood by Census tract using anonymized longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population.For each tract, we estimate children's earnings distributions, incarceration rates, and other outcomes in adulthood by parental income, race, and gender.These estimates allow us to trace the roots of outcomes such as poverty and incarceration back to the neighborhoods in which children grew up.We find that children's outcomes vary sharply across nearby areas: for children of parents at the 25th percentile of the income distribution, the standard deviation of mean household income at age 35 is $5,000 across tracts within counties.We illustrate how these tract-level data can provide insight into how neighborhoods shape the development of human capital and support local economic policy using two applications.First, the estimates permit precise targeting of policies to improve economic opportunity by uncovering specific neighborhoods where certain subgroups of children grow up to have poor outcomes.Neighborhoods matter at a very granular level: conditional on characteristics such as poverty rates in a child's own Census tract, characteristics of tracts that are one mile away have little predictive power for a child's outcomes.Our historical estimates are informative predictors of outcomes even for children growing up today because neighborhood conditions are relatively stable over time.Second, we show that the observational estimates are highly predictive of neighborhoods' causal effects, based on a comparison to data from the Moving to Opportunity experiment and a quasi-experimental research design analyzing movers' outcomes.We then identify high-opportunity neighborhoods that are affordable to lowincome families, providing an input into the design of affordable housing policies.Our measures of children's long-term outcomes are only weakly correlated with traditional proxies for local economic success such as rates of job growth, showing that the conditions that create greater upward mobility are not necessarily the same as those that lead to productive labor markets.",https://openalex.org/W2896936987,openalex

Many observers believe that this gradient is simply a matter of poor health for the disadvantaged and good health for everyone else, but this is an inadequate analysis. The Whitehall Study documented a social gradient in mortality rates, even among people who are not poor, and this pattern has been confirmed by data from the United States and elsewhere. The social gradient in health is influenced by such factors as social position; relative versus absolute deprivation; and control and social participation. To understand causality and generate policies to improve health, we must consider the relationship between social environment and health and especially the importance of early life experiences.",https://openalex.org/W4242501010,openalex

Based on circulation features, cold surges are grouped into two general types: wave train and blocking types. The blocking type of cold surge tends to occur during negative AO periods, that is, the AO-related polarity of the blocking type. However, the wave train type is observed during both positive and negative AO periods, although the wave train features associated with negative AO are relatively weaker. The cold surges during negative AO are stronger than those during positive AO in terms of both amplitude and duration. The cold surges during positive AO in which the extent of effect is confined to inland China passes through East Asia quickly because of weaker Siberian high and Aleutian low, leading to short duration of these cold surges. In contrast, the cold surge during negative AO, characterized by a well-organized anticyclone–cyclone couplet with high pressure over continental East Asia and low pressure over Japan, brings continuous cold air into the entire East Asian region for more than one week with long-lasting cold advection. It is also found that the tracks of the cold surges during negative AO tend to occur more frequently over Korea and Japan and less frequently over China, compared with those during positive AO. The tracks are related to a west–east dipole structure of the ratio of rain conversion to snow according to AO phase, resulting in freezing precipitation or snowfall events over inland China (Korea and Japan) are likely to occur more frequently during the positive (negative) AO periods.",https://openalex.org/W2079880447,openalex

In most models, overestimation of the Pacific blocking frequency is also evident for all durations throughout the year.

Brody; Tianyi Yu; Edith Chen; Steven R. H. Beach; Gregory E. Miller,2015.0,,"Background Research has suggested that ‘risky’ family processes have unforeseen negative consequences for health later in life. The purpose of this study was to further understanding of risky family environments and development of health vulnerabilities by (a) examining the likelihood that elevated levels of parental depressive symptoms when children are age 11 forecast accelerated epigenetic aging 9 years later at age 20; (b) determining whether participation in an efficacious family‐centered prevention program focused on enhancing supportive parenting and strengthening family relationships will ameliorate this association; and (c) testing a moderation‐mediation hypothesis that prevention‐induced reductions in harsh parenting across adolescence will account for prevention effects in reducing accelerated epigenetic aging. Methods In the rural southeastern United States, parents and 11‐year‐old children from 399 families participated in the Strong African American Families ( SAAF ) program or a control condition. Parents reported their own depressive symptoms when their children were 11, and both youths and parents reported youth exposure to harsh parenting at ages 11 and 16. Blood was drawn from youths at age 20 to measure accelerated epigenetic aging using a marker derived from the DNA methylation of cells. Results Elevated parental depressive symptoms forecast accelerated epigenetic aging among youths in the control condition, but not among SAAF participants. Moderated‐mediation analyses confirmed that reductions in harsh parenting accounted for SAAF 's protective effects on epigenetic aging. Subsequent exploratory analyses indicated that accelerated epigenetic aging forecast emotional distress among young adults in the control condition but not among those who participated in SAAF . Conclusions This study is unique in using a randomized prevention trial to test hypotheses about the ways risky family processes contribute to accelerated epigenetic aging. The results suggest that developmentally appropriate family‐centered interventions designed to enhance parenting and strengthen families can buffer the biological residue of life in a risky family.",https://openalex.org/W2209048510,openalex

While this is a welcome trend, it necessitates geographic information systems (GIS) skills and imposes new challenges for data collection and analysis. So far, solutions to these challenges differ between studies, obstructing direct comparison of findings and hampering replication and extension of earlier work. This article presents a standardized structure for storing, manipulating, and analyzing high-resolution spatial data. PRIO-GRID is a vector grid network with a resolution of 0.5 x 0.5 decimal degrees, covering all terrestrial areas of the world. Gridded data comprise inherently apolitical entities; the grid cells are fixed in time and space, they are insensitive to political boundaries and developments, and they are completely exogenous to likely features of interest, such as civil war outbreak, ethnic settlement patterns, extreme weather events, or the spatial distribution of wealth. Moreover, unlike other disaggregated approaches, gridded data may be scaled up or down in a consistent manner by varying the resolution of the grid. The released dataset comes with cell-specific information on a large selection of political, economic, demographic, environmental, and conflict variables for all years, 1946–2008. A simple descriptive data assessment of population density and economic activity is offered to demonstrate how PRIO-GRID may be applied in quantitative social science research.",https://openalex.org/W2075708635,openalex

McGill; M. M. Humphries,2011.0,,"Aim It has been qualitatively understood for a long time that climate change will have widely varying effects on human well-being in different regions of the world. The spatial complexities underlying our relationship to climate and the geographical disparities in human demographic change have, however, precluded the development of global indices of the predicted regional impacts of climate change on humans. Humans will be most negatively affected by climate change in regions where populations are strongly dependent on climate and favourable climatic conditions decline. Here we use the relationship between the distribution of human population density and climate as a basis to develop the first global index of predicted impacts of climate change on human populations. Location Global. Methods We use spatially explicit models of the present relationship between human population density and climate along with forecasted climate change to predict climate vulnerabilities over the coming decades. We then globally represent regional disparities in human population dynamics estimated with our ecological niche model and with a demographic forecast and contrast these disparities with CO2 emissions data to quantitatively evaluate the notion of moral hazard in climate change policies. Results Strongly negative impacts of climate change are predicted in Central America, central South America, the Arabian Peninsula, Southeast Asia and much of Africa. Importantly, the regions of greatest vulnerability are generally distant from the high-latitude regions where the magnitude of climate change will be greatest. Furthermore, populations contributing the most to greenhouse gas emissions on a per capita basis are unlikely to experience the worst impacts of climate change, satisfying the conditions for a moral hazard in climate change policies. Main conclusions Regionalized analysis of relationships between distribution of human population density and climate provides a novel framework for developing global indices of human vulnerability to climate change. The predicted consequences of climate change on human populations are correlated with the factors causing climate change at the regional level, providing quantitative support for many qualitative statements found in international climate change assessments.",https://openalex.org/W1630545993,openalex

The effects on economic status of early childbearing were primarily negative and operated indirectly through intervening variables such as, decreased educational levels and higher fertility rates. For each year a birth was postponed, annual earnings at age 27 were increased by $197. Surprisingly, women who had a child at age 15 or 16 experienced fewer negative economic effects at age 27 than those who had a child at age 17 or 18; perhaps the younger girls continued to live with their parental family and remained in school while the slightly older girls left the parental family and dropped out of school. The negative economic effects at age 27 for black women who bore a child at an early age were less pronounced than for white women. Policy makers should be aware of these long-term negative economic effects of early childbirth and efforts should be made 1) to increase child care programs which enable young mothers to continue their schooling; 2) to provide family planning services to young mothers who are at greater risk of subsequently having large families; 3) to encourage young mothers to remain living with their parental family; and 4) to provide additional training and job counseling for young mothers.

Granovetter has demonstrated with his concept of social embeddedness that early employment contacts can enhance the prospects of getting a job and subsequent occupational mobility. The alternative implication is that youths who are embedded in criminal contexts can become isolated from the likelihood of legitimate adult employment. This has important implications for an understanding of crime and unemployment, for while much of past macro‐level research confirms that unemployment leads to crime in the aggregate, the reverse is likely true at the individual level among adolescents and young adults, especially in community settings with serious crime and unemployment problems. The implications of criminal embeddedness are explored in a well‐known set of London panel data.

Although both microbial and nematode communities regulated litter C and N loss in the early decomposition stages, soil moisture and legacy effects of initial differences in litter quality played a major role in the late stages of the process.

Kercher,2000.0,,"Species richness describes the number of species of a given taxon in a given time and space. The energy limitation hypothesis links the species richness of consumer taxa to net primary productivity (NPP) through two relationships: NPP limits a taxon's density, and taxon density limits species richness. We study both relationships with a survey of 15 ground ant assemblages, along a productivity gradient from deserts to rain forests. Ant density (colonies m-2) was a positive, decelerating function of net aboveground productivity (NAP). A stepwise regression suggests that the efficiency with which NAP is converted to ant colonies increases with maximum summer temperature and decreases with precipitation. Ant species richness was a positive decelerating function of density at three spatial scales. This supports the energy limitation hypothesis' assumption that average population densities are higher in environments that are more productive. These two nonlinear functions (NAP-density and density-species richness) combine to create, at a variety of scales, positive, decelerating, productivity-diversity curves for a common, ecologically dominant taxon across the terrestrial productivity gradient. However, variance in the density and diversity explained by NAP decreases with scale, suggesting that energy limitation of diversity predominates at small spatial scales (<1 ha).",https://openalex.org/W2172998656,openalex

They say risk works to widen securitisation whereby exceptional measures are made permanent and introduced to deal with merely potential, hypothetical and less-than-existential dangers. A transformation in the political logic of the security field of this kind is a potentially problematic and momentous change. However, this has so far not been much reflected in the primary theory of what security is, namely the Copenhagen School’s theory of securitisation. This article tries to tackle this problem by identifying the distinct logic of speech acts that turn issues into questions of risk politics suggesting a model for what rules or grammars they follow and what the political implications of them are. A separate kind of speech act – ‘riskification’ – is identified based on a re-theorisation of what distinguishes ‘risks’ from ‘threats’. It is argued that risk politics is not an instance of securitisation, but something distinct with its own advantages and dangers. Threat-based security deals with direct causes of harm, whereas risk-security is oriented towards the conditions of possibility or constitutive causes of harm a kind of ‘second-order’ security politics that promotes long-term precautionary governance. Separating securitisation and ‘riskification’ preserves the analytical precision of the Copenhagen School notion of securitisation, makes a new logic of security understandable to analysts of the security field, and helps to clarify what basic logic ‘normal’ non-securitised politics may follow. The new framework is demonstrated through a critical reading of literature that has suggested that climate change has been securitised.",https://openalex.org/W1976119410,openalex

Lenton; Andrew Watson,2000.0,,"The continuous charcoal record, interpreted with the aid of the results of combustion experiments, indicates that the mixing ratio of atmospheric oxygen has varied remarkably little over the past 350 Myr. We develop a dynamic feedback model of the coupled P, N, C, and O 2 cycles and use perturbation analysis and a case study of the past 40 Myr to test various feedback mechanisms that have been proposed to stabilize atmospheric oxygen. These mechanisms involve alterations in nutrient driven productivity and the subsequent burial flux of organic carbon, which provides the main source of atmospheric oxygen. Suppression of the burial of phosphorus sorbed to iron minerals under anoxic conditions in ocean bottom waters tends to increase the ocean nutrient inventory and provide negative feedback against declining oxygen [ Holland, 1994]. However, denitrification is enhanced by anoxia, tending to reduce the nutrient inventory and amplify declining oxygen [ Lenton and Watson , this issue]. If organic phosphorus removal from the ocean is also suppressed under anoxic conditions, this improves oxygen regulation [ Van Cappellen and Ingall , 1994], as does direct enhancement of organic carbon burial due to reduced oxygen concentration in bottom waters [ Betts and Holland , 1991]. However, all of the ocean‐based feedback mechanisms cease to operate under increases in oxygen that remove anoxia from the ocean. Fire frequency is extremely sensitive to increases in oxygen above 21% of the atmosphere, readily suppressing vegetation on the land surface. This should transfer phosphorus from the land to the ocean, causing less carbon to be buried per unit of phosphorus and providing a weak negative feedback on oxygen [ Kump , 1988]. However, a new proposal that increases in oxygen suppress the biological amplification of rock weathering and hence the input of phosphorus to the Earth system provides the most effective oxygen regulation of all the mechanisms considered. A range of proxies suggests that the input of available phosphorus to the ocean may have been significantly reduced 40 Myr ago, suppressing new production and organic carbon burial in the model. With only ocean‐based feedback, the atmospheric oxygen reservoir is predicted to have shrunk from ∼26% of the atmosphere 40 Myr ago. However, when land plant mediated negative feedback on phosphorus weathering is added, oxygen is regulated within 19–21% of the atmosphere throughout the past 40 Myr, in a manner more consistent with paleorecords.",https://openalex.org/W2103585008,openalex

Trenberth,2011.0,,"Abstract Past attribution studies of climate change have assumed a null hypothesis of no role of human activities. The challenge, then, is to prove that there is an anthropogenic component. I argue that because global warming is “unequivocal” and ‘very likely’ caused by human activities, the reverse should now be the case. The task, then, could be to prove there is no anthropogenic component to a particular observed change in climate, although a more useful task is to determine what it is. In Bayesian statistics, this change might be thought of as adding a ‘prior’. The benefit of doubt and uncertainties about observations and models are then switched. Moreover, the science community is much too conservative on this issue and too many authors make what are called ‘Type II errors’ whereby they erroneously accept the null hypothesis. Global warming is contributing to a changing incidence of extreme weather because the environment in which all storms form has changed from human activities.

Additionally, a number of diagnostic tests are utilised to ensure that the model is suitable and correct. Interestingly, our results reveal that tourism and economic growth are cointegrated.

While a significant literature has investigated the calorie-income elasticity abstracting from production, this paper provides an empirical application of the nonseparable household model linking the effect of exogenous variation in planting season production decisions via climate variability on household dietary diversity. Using degree days, rainfall and agricultural capital stocks as instruments, the effect of production on household dietary diversity at harvest is estimated. The empirical specifications estimate production effects on dietary diversity using both agricultural revenue and crop production diversity. Significant effects of both agricultural revenue and crop production diversity on dietary diversity are estimated. The dietary diversity-production elasticities imply that a 10 per cent increase in agricultural revenue or crop diversity result in a 1.8 per cent or 2.4 per cent increase in dietary diversity respectively. These results illustrate that agricultural income growth or increased crop diversity may not be sufficient to ensure improved dietary diversity. Increases in agricultural revenue do change diet composition. Estimates of the effect of agricultural income on share of calories by food groups indicate relatively large changes in diet composition. On average, a 10 per cent increase in agricultural revenue makes households 7.2 per cent more likely to consume vegetables, 3.5 per cent more likely to consume fish, and increases the share of tubers consumed by 5.2 per cent.",https://openalex.org/W2132743341,openalex

These results suggest that non-renewable energy consumption can induce CO2 emissions increase. In addition, Thailand is carbon emissions dependent on energy consumption for its rapid economic growth, causing considerable CO2 emissions.

This study uses five different models i.e., each model have an important policy implication in the context of Pakistan. The results indicate that, on the short run, there is a significant negative relationship between economic growth & carbon emissions and economic growth & poverty while there is a positive relationship between i) economic growth & income inequality; and ii) poverty & income inequality. On the long-run, there is a significant positive relationship between GDP & income inequality, carbon dioxide emissions & income inequality, and poverty & income inequality in Pakistan.

Using observations from 34 eddy covariance sites in different biomes across Europe, we studied the sensitivity of gross primary productivity (GPP) to environmental drivers during the summer drought of 2018 versus the reference summer of 2016. We found a greater drought-induced decline of summer GPP in grasslands (-38%) than in forests (-10%), which coincided with reduced evapotranspiration and soil water content (SWC). As compared to the 'normal year' of 2016, GPP in different ecosystems exhibited more negative sensitivity to summer air temperature (Ta) but stronger positive sensitivity to SWC during summer drought in 2018, that is, a stronger reduction of GPP with soil moisture deficit. We found larger negative effects of Ta and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) but a lower positive effect of photosynthetic photon flux density on GPP in 2018 compared to 2016, which contributed to reduced summer GPP in 2018. Our results demonstrate that high temperature-induced increases in VPD and decreases in SWC aggravated drought impacts on GPP.

Here, we show that the cold ocean temperatures were the most extreme in the modern record over much of the mid-high latitude North-East Atlantic. Further, by considering surface heat loss, ocean heat content and wind driven upwelling we explain for the first time the genesis of this cold ocean anomaly. We find that it is primarily due to extreme ocean heat loss driven by atmospheric circulation changes in the preceding two winters combined with the re-emergence of cold ocean water masses. Furthermore, we reveal that a similar cold Atlantic anomaly was also present prior to the most extreme European heat waves since the 1980s indicating that it is a common factor in the development of these events. For the specific case of 2015, we show that the ocean anomaly is linked to a stationary position of the Jet Stream that favours the development of high surface temperatures over Central Europe during the heat wave. Our study calls for an urgent assessment of the impact of ocean drivers on major European summer temperature extremes in order to provide better advance warning measures of these high societal impact events.",https://openalex.org/W2473336205,openalex

The essence of these systems is structural simplicity combined with high year-to-year variation in weather. We argue that such conditions simplify study of the mechanisms underlying changes in rate of increase of herbivores. Except where the herbivore is intrinsically regulated by spacing behaviour, the systems are best summarised by the functional and numerical responses of the herbivores to available forage, coupled with the growth response of the plants. A graphing of rate of increase against density provides little insight even though these systems are density-dependent in the formal sense. We show that long-term aperiodic fluctuations characteristic of such systems are, at least for kangaroos, a mathematical consequence of unpredictable short-term fluctuations in weather. Even when the weather has no time trend there will be marked trends in numbers of herbivores, either up or down, on a time scale of one or two decades. Such trends are intrinsic to the system and do not necessarily reflect special and persistent causes. Similar fluctuations of caribou numbers may be, at least in part, of similar origin.",https://openalex.org/W2033630826,openalex

This finding is termed the ""obesity paradox"" and is well recognized in the cardio-metabolic literature but less so in oncology. Here, we summarize the epidemiological findings related to the obesity paradox in cancer. Our review highlights that many observations of the obesity paradox in cancer reflect methodological mechanisms including the crudeness of BMI as an obesity measure, confounding, detection bias, reverse causality, and a specific form of the selection bias, known as collider bias. It is imperative for the oncologist to interpret the observation of the obesity paradox against the above methodological framework and avoid the misinterpretation that being obese might be ""good"" or ""protective"" for cancer patients.",https://openalex.org/W2482556255,openalex

Myneni,2004.0,,"Abstract The authors use the notion of Granger causality to investigate the relationship between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) over the Northern Hemisphere. The Granger causality analysis ensures that any apparent oceanic influence upon the atmosphere (as measured by the NAO) is provided by the ocean and is not related to preexisting conditions within the NAO itself (and vice versa when looking at the atmospheric influence upon the ocean). Although this statistical technique does not imply physical forcing of one field on the other, it is generally more reliable compared to the simple lead/lagged correlation. Using this technique, the authors find that on seasonal time scales, the preceding NAO anomalies' influence on the wintertime SST field is rather restricted. Conversely, preceding SST anomalies have a statistically significant causal effect on the wintertime NAO. However, the causal relation between preceding SSTs and the wintertime NAO is limited to the Gulf Stream extension; in contrast to the canonical tripole SST pattern typically associated with the NAO, the authors do not find that SST anomalies in either the Greenland or subtropical regions have a significant causal effect on the NAO. These results suggest that the Gulf Stream SSTs have an important influence in initiating disturbances of the atmospheric circulation over the wintertime North Atlantic.",https://openalex.org/W2088896295,openalex

Ellison,1995.0,,"One of the most serious criticisms of research on the contact hypothesis is the contention that selection bias operates to promote interaction between whites and blacks who are already relatively unprejudiced toward one another. Accordingly, attempts to infer the effect of interracial contact on racial attitudes must recognize and correct for this potential source of bias. Endogenous switching regression models are used to estimate the effect of close interracial friendship on selected racial attitude variables while accounting for possible selectivity bias. Each model implies a distinct assumption about the process generating interracial contact and racial attitudes. Using data from the National Survey of Black Americans, we find no evidence of sample selection bias in estimating the effect of close interracial contact on black racial attitudes. Therefore, we cannot reject the conventional models used in research on the contact hypothesis that treat interracial contact as an exogenous variable affecting racial attitudes. However, our results show the usefulness of a switching regressions approach to reveal the contingent nature of the contact hypothesis.",https://openalex.org/W2029712675,openalex

A810,The Decrease in Summer Surface Water Temperature with Altitude in Swiss Alpine Lakes: A Comparison with Air Temperature Lapse Rates,https://doi.org/10.2307/1552583,David M. Livingstone; André F. Lotter; Ian R. Walker,1999.0,,"Using miniature thermistors with integrated data loggers, the decrease in summer lake surface water temperature (LSWT) with increasing altitude a.s.l. was investigated in 10 Swiss Alpine lakes located between 613 m a.s.l. and 2339 m a.s.l. The LSWTs exhibit essentially the same short-term structure as regional air temperature, but are about 3 to 5°C higher than the air temperature at the altitude of the lake. LSWTs decrease approximately linearly with increasing altitude at a rate slightly greater than the surface air temperature lapse rate. Diel variations in LSWT are large, implying that single water temperature measurements are unlikely to be representative of the mean. Local factors will affect LSWT more than they affect air temperature, possibly resulting in severe distortion of the empirical relationship between the two. Several implications for paleoclimate reconstruction studies result. (1) Paleolimnologically reconstructed LSWTs are likely to be higher than the air temperatures prevailing at the altitude of the lake. (2) Lakes used for paleoclimate reconstruction should be selected to minimize local effects on LSWT. (3) The calibration of organism-specific quantitative paleotemperature inference models should not be based on single water temperature measurements. (4) Consideration should be given to calibrating such models directly against air temperature rather than water temperature. (5) The primary climate effect on the aquatic biota of high-altitude lakes may be mediated by the timing of the ice cover.",https://openalex.org/W2320427834,openalex

Drawing on a contest success function model, we show that geographic factors (such as location, terrain, and natural resources) interact with rebel fighting capacity and together play a crucial role in determining the duration of conflict. Using precisely dated duration data in event history models and geographic data for the conflict location, we find that conflicts located at considerable distance from the main government stronghold, along remote international borders and in regions with valuable minerals last substantially longer. In addition, we find that rebel military capacity in its own right increases the prospects of a civil conflict ending within a short time period.

A WHO Cross-National Survey"" was started by researchers from three European countries. Presently, more than 10 countries within the European region of WHO are accepted as members of the project. The study is oriented towards behavioural and social science, and its basic philosophy is described as a lifestyle approach. In the first part of this article, differences between traditional epidemiological research and lifestyle research are outlined. The concept ""lifestyle"" is clarified, and the focuses of lifestyle, health promotion and health education research are described. It is argued that aspects of lifestyle not considered to be directly related to mortality or morbidity may be more important for an understanding of lifestyle of individuals or groups than aspects more directly related to health. Health-related habits, lifestyle and psychosocial aspects of health are chosen as criterion variables of the study. The personal and environmental context of lifestyle are the main factors on the predictor side, and the findings should also be discussed in a demographic and macrosocial context. National cross-sectional surveys (n at least 3000) are carried out regularly in an increasing number of countries. Data are collected anonymously at school, covering three age groups (mean age 11.5, 13.5, and 15.5 years). One part of the questionnaire consists of a core of questions and is repeated in every survey. The other part has a special focus which changes from survey to survey. Comparability of data across countries is given high priority. Results from the first survey (1983–84) are presented to illustrate the relative importance of country, indicators of inequality, social network, and beliefs in the harmful effects of smoking as predictors of smoking habits. The results confirm that a wide range of predictors are important. In line with the philosophy of the project, the focus of the second survey (1985–86) is on physical activity (as a positive health habit) and psychosocial aspects of health. Finally the report mentions some of the more practical and administrative problems related to this kind of cross-national research, and describes some of the limitations of large-scale cross-national surveys.",https://openalex.org/W2063019951,openalex

Ian Smith,2008.0,,"Abstract The association between Southern Hemisphere cyclones and anticyclones and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), southern annular mode (SAM), Antarctic sea ice extent (SIE), and rainfall in Perth and Melbourne is explored. Those cities are, respectively, located in the southwestern and southeastern corners of Australia, where substantial decreasing rainfall trends have been observed over the last decades. The need for a more unified understanding of large-scale anomalies in storm indicators associated with the climate features itemized above has motivated this study. The main aim is to identify cyclone-anomalous areas that are potentially important in characterizing continental rainfall anomalies from a hemispheric perspective, focusing on midlatitude Australia. The study covers the “satellite era” from 1979 to 2003 and was conducted for the southern winter when midlatitude rainfall is predominantly baroclinic. The results indicate a well-organized hemispheric cyclone pattern associated with ENSO, SAM, SIE, and rainfall anomalies. There is a moderate large-scale, high-latitude resemblance between La Niña, negative SAM, and reduced SIE in some sectors. In particular, there is a suggestion that SIE anomalies over the Indian Ocean and Western Australia sectors are associated with a large-scale pattern of cyclone/anticyclone anomalies that is more pronounced over the longitudes of Australia and New Zealand. Spatial correlation analysis suggests a robust link between cyclone density over the sectors mentioned above and rainfall in Perth and Melbourne. Statistical analyses of rainfall and SIE show modest correlations for Perth and weak correlations for Melbourne, generally corroborating the above. It is proposed that SAM and SIE are part of a complex physical system that is best understood as a coupled mechanism, and that their impacts on the circulation can be seen as partially independent of ENSO. While SAM and SIE have greater influence on the circulation affecting rainfall in the western side of Australia, ENSO is the dominant influence on the eastern half of the country. A contraction of the sea ice seems to be accompanied by a southward shift of high-latitude cyclones, which is also hypothesized to increase downstream cyclone density at midlatitudes via conservation of mass, similarly to what is observed during the extreme positive phase of the SAM. These associations build on previous developments in the literature. They bring a more unified view on high-latitude climate features, and may also help to explain the declining trends in Australian rainfall.",https://openalex.org/W1994800756,openalex

Smith,2014.0,,"While both academics and politicians have long acknowledged the connection between food price shocks and so-called ‘food riots’, this article asks whether rising domestic consumer food prices are a contributing cause of sociopolitical unrest, more broadly defined, in urban areas of Africa. In order to unravel the complex and circular relationship between rising food prices and unrest, an instrumental approach with country fixed effects is used to isolate causality at the country-month unit of analysis for the period 1990 through 2012. Two instrumental variables, changes in international grain commodity prices and local rainfall scarcity, are evaluated and used individually and jointly as instruments for changes in domestic food prices. The main finding is that a sudden increase in domestic food prices in a given month significantly increases the probability of urban unrest, especially spontaneous events and riots, in that month. Undeniably, more fundamental economic and political grievances are also drivers of such events and are likely to determine how the unrest ultimately manifests, even when triggered by rising food prices. Although more research is necessary to determine why people choose particular protest methods and targets, the findings of this research provide evidence that sociopolitical unrest of different types is driven, or at least triggered, by a consumer response to economic pressure from increasing food prices regardless of the cause of the increase.",https://openalex.org/W2028351337,openalex

Confirming results obtained in laboratory studies, more family disturbances were recorded when ozone levels were high than when they were low. Two-stage regression analyses indicated that disturbances and assaults against persons were also positively correlated with daily temperatures and negatively correlated with wind speed and levels of humidity. Further, distributed lag (Box-Jenkins) analyses indicated that high temperatures and low winds preceded violent episodes, which occurred more often on dry than humid days. In addition to hypothesized relations, it was also found that assaults follow complaints about family disturbances, which suggests that the latter could be used to predict and lessen physical violence. It was concluded that atmospheric conditions and violent episodes are not only correlated but also appear to be linked in a causal fashion.

Parsons,2004.0,,"Maps of fuels and fire regimes are essential for understanding ecological relationships between wildland fire and landscape structure, composition, and function, and for managing wildland fire hazard and risk with an ecosystem perspective. While critical for successful wildland fire management, there are no standard methods for creating these maps, and spatial data representing these important characteristics of wildland fire are lacking in many areas. We present an integrated approach for mapping fuels and fire regimes using extensive field sampling, remote sensing, ecosystem simulation, and biophysical gradient modeling to create predictive landscape maps of fuels and fire regimes. A main objective was to develop a standardized, repeatable system for creating these maps using spatial data describing important landscape gradients along with straightforward statistical methods. We developed a hierarchical approach to stratifying field sampling to ensure that samples represented variability in a wide variety of ecosystem processes. We used existing and derived spatial layers to develop a modeling database within a Geographic Information System that included 38 mapped variables describing gradients of physiography, spectral characteristics, weather, and biogeochemical cycles for a 5830-km2 study area in northwestern Montana. Using general linear models, discriminant analysis, classification and regression trees, and logistic regression, we created maps of fuel load, fuel model, fire interval, and fire severity based on spatial predictive variables and response variables measured in the field. Independently evaluated accuracies ranged from 51 to 80%. Direct gradient modeling improved map accuracy significantly compared to maps based solely on indirect gradients. By focusing efforts on direct as opposed to indirect gradient modeling, our approach is easily adaptable to mapping potential future conditions under a range of possible management actions or climate scenarios. Our methods are an example of a standard yet flexible approach for mapping fuels and fire regimes over broad areas and at multiple scales. The resulting maps provide fine-grained, broad-scale information to spatially assess both ecosystem integrity and the hazards and risks of wildland fire when making decisions about how best to restore forests of the western United States to within historical ranges and variability.",https://openalex.org/W2033130094,openalex

This paper examines the effect of weather conditions around the time of birth on the health, education, and socioeconomic outcomes of Indonesian adults born between 1953 and 1974. We link historical rainfall for each individual's birth year and birth location with current adult outcomes from the 2000 wave of the Indonesia Family Life Survey. Higher early-life rainfall has large positive effects on the adult outcomes of women, but not of men. Women with 20% higher rainfall in their year and location of birth attain 0.14 centimeters greater height, finish 0.15 more years of schooling, live in households with 5.2% higher expenditures per capita, and have spouses with 5.1% higher earnings. These patterns most plausibly reflect a positive impact of rainfall on agricultural output, leading to higher household incomes and better health for infant girls. We present suggestive evidence that eventual benefits for adult women's socioeconomic status are mediated by improved schooling attainment, which leads to higher spousal quality, which in turn improves socioeconomic status. Adult women's education and health do not appear to have direct effects on their socioeconomic status apart from indirect effects via spousal quality.",https://openalex.org/W2109361466,openalex

A robust result is that lower emissions are strongly associated with better economic performance. After pretesting for stationarity, we find evidence of a one‐way causation from emissions and environmental disclosure to economic performance, but no evidence of reverse causation. We also find strong evidence of a one‐way causation from emissions to disclosure, but no evidence of reverse causation.

We develop an emergent constraint based on eddy feedback, which is 1.2 to 3 times too weak in the models, suggesting that the real-world weakening lies towards the higher end of the model simulations. Still, the modelled response to Arctic sea ice loss is weak: the North Atlantic Oscillation response is similar in magnitude and offsets the projected response to increased greenhouse gases, but would only account for around 10% of variations in individual years.

Wenger; Wouter Berghuijs,2016.0,,"Abstract Path analyses of historical streamflow data from the Pacific Northwest indicate that the precipitation amount has been the dominant control on the magnitude of low streamflow extremes compared to the air temperature‐affected timing of snowmelt runoff. The relative sensitivities of low streamflow to precipitation and temperature changes have important implications for adaptation planning because global circulation models produce relatively robust estimates of air temperature changes but have large uncertainties in projected precipitation amounts in the Pacific Northwest U.S. Quantile regression analyses indicate that low streamflow extremes from the majority of catchments in this study have declined from 1948 to 2013, which may significantly affect terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and water resource management. Trends in the 25th percentile of mean annual streamflow have declined and the center of timing has occurred earlier. We quantify the relative influences of total precipitation and air temperature on the annual low streamflow extremes from 42 stream gauges using mean annual streamflow as a proxy for precipitation amount effects and streamflow center of timing as a proxy for temperature effects on low flow metrics, including 7q10 summer (the minimum 7 day flow during summer with a 10 year return period), mean August , mean September , mean summer , 7q10 winter , and mean winter flow metrics. These methods have the benefit of using only readily available streamflow data, which makes our results robust against systematic errors in high elevation distributed precipitation data.

The different datasets and model simulations all show a similar negative-dominant S–P correlation pattern with wet areas having more significantly negative correlations than the dry areas. The experiments with CAM3 show that this correlation pattern is not caused by the soil moisture feedback. Rather, the combined effect of the precipitation variability and the memory of soil moisture is the main reason for this correlation pattern. Theoretical analysis confirms this conclusion and shows that the correlation pattern is related to both the precipitation spectrum and the time scale of soil moisture retention.

Evidence is found for a central part of this model (that child behaviour problems lead to parental stress), but other aspects are as yet untested in the developmental disability field. Future refinement of the model is discussed, with an emphasis on the role of parental appraisal processes in understanding the mechanisms by which child behaviour problems affect parental well being. Finally, the practical implications of integrating research on children's behaviour problems and parental stress are briefly considered.",https://openalex.org/W2139967489,openalex

It is generally believed that increasing the consumption of renewable energy is an effective measure to promote CO2 emissions reduction. Therefore, renewable energy consumption has become one of the best alternative strategies for sustainable development. Based on this, this paper employs the 3SLS model to conduct an empirical study on the relations among real output, renewable energy consumption, and CO2 emissions of BRICS countries (except Russia) in 1999–2014. The empirical results support, for BRICS group, the complete tri-variate relationships (energy-output-emission nexus), and renewable energy had a significant positive impact on the real output, and vice versa. Besides, compared with other countries, Brazil also has the same tri-variate relationships as BRICS group. However, China has no relationship from real output to renewable energy consumption and from real output to CO2 emissions; India does not have the relationship from real output to renewable energy consumption and the bilateral relationship between real output and CO2 emissions; the relationship between variables in South Africa only occurs in the energy output chain. Finally, according to the estimation results of the simultaneous equation, the BRICs governments should consider the importance of human capital level and financial development when controlling the real output level and pollution. In addition, it should be noted that effective energy policies help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions without compromising real output.",https://openalex.org/W3007856992,openalex

Kendall,2019.0,,"Abstract Randomized experiments have long been the gold standard in determining causal effects in ecological control–impact studies. However, it may be difficult to address many ecologically and policy‐relevant control–impact questions‐such as the effect of forest fragmentation or protected areas on biodiversity through experimental manipulation due to scale, costs and ethical considerations. Yet, ecologists may still draw causal insights in observational control–impact settings by exploiting research designs that approximate the experimental ideal. Here, we review the challenges of making causal inference in non‐experimental control–impact scenarios as well as a suite of statistical tools specifically designed to overcome such challenges. These tools are widely used in fields where experimental research is more limited (i.e., medicine, economics), and could be applied by ecologists across numerous sub‐disciplines. Using hypothetical examples, we discuss why bias is likely to plague observational control–impact studies in ways that do not surface with experimental manipulations, why bias is generally the barrier to causal inference, and different methods to overcome this bias. Satellite‐, survey‐ and citizen–science data hold great potential for advancing key questions in ecology that would otherwise be prohibitive to pursue experimentally. However, to harness such data to understand causal impacts of land, environmental and policy changes, we must expand our toolset such that we can improve inference and more confidently advance ecological understanding and science‐informed policy.",https://openalex.org/W2937513106,openalex

The character and fallibilities of the human judgement process itself lead to persistent disagreements even among competent, honest, and disinterested experts. Social Judgement Theory provides powerful methods for analysing such judgementally based disagreements when the experts' judgement processes can be represented by additive models involving the same cues. However, the validity and usefulness of such representations depend on several conditions: (a) experts must agree on a problem definition, (b) experts must have access to the same information, and (c) experts must use the same organising principles. When these conditions are not met, methods for diagnosing and treating disagreement are poorly understood. As a start towards developing such an understanding, sources of expert disagreement are discussed and categorised.",https://openalex.org/W2021981893,openalex

This, in combination with very slow progress in the area of molecular genetics, has generated interest in more complicated models of schizophrenia etiology that explicitly posit gene-environment interactions (EU-GEI. European Network of Schizophrenia Networks for the Study of Gene Environment Interactions. Schizophrenia aetiology: do gene-environment interactions hold the key? [published online ahead of print April 25, 2008] Schizophr Res; S0920-9964(08) 00170–9). Although findings of epidemiological gene-environment interaction (G × E) studies are suggestive of widespread gene-environment interactions in the etiology of schizophrenia, numerous challenges remain. For example, attempts to identify gene-environment interactions cannot be equated with molecular genetic studies with a few putative environmental variables ""thrown in"": G × E is a multidisciplinary exercise involving epidemiology, psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, neuroimaging, pharmacology, biostatistics, and genetics. Epidemiological G × E studies using indirect measures of genetic risk in genetically sensitive designs have the advantage that they are able to model the net, albeit nonspecific, genetic load. In studies using direct molecular measures of genetic variation, a hypothesis-driven approach postulating synergistic effects between genes and environment impacting on a final common pathway, such as ""sensitization"" of mesolimbic dopamine neurotransmission, while simplistic, may provide initial focus and protection against the numerous false-positive and false-negative results that these investigations engender. Experimental ecogenetic approaches with randomized assignment may help to overcome some of the limitations of observational studies and allow for the additional elucidation of underlying mechanisms using a combination of functional enviromics and functional genomics.",https://openalex.org/W2117633779,openalex

Results indicate that the loss of sea ice over the Barents Sea (SICBS) in March might have influenced the hot drought events over NEC in JA for the period of 1997–2016. Further analyses reveal that lower SICBS is closely related to thinner snow depth over western Eurasia (SDWEA) in April. The decline of SDWEA leads to drier soil from the Yangtze River valley to northern China during May–June, which is favorable for precipitation deficiency over NEC in JA. Besides, the loss of SICBS in March and decline of SDWEA in April are closely related to the polar–Eurasia teleconnection pattern and dry soil over NEC in JA, which provides favorable atmospheric circulation patterns for occurrences of hot droughts. The large ensemble simulations from the Community Earth System Model and the numerical experiments based on version 4 of the Community Atmosphere Model further confirmed their connections and the associated possible physical processes. Therefore, snow depth and soil moisture might serve as linkages between Barents Sea ice in March and hot droughts over NEC during JA, and the Barents Sea ice in March might be an important potential predictor for the summer hot droughts over NEC.",https://openalex.org/W2794408096,openalex

Importantly, it finds that loneliness contributes more to materialism than the other way around. Moreover, it finds that materialism's contribution to loneliness is not uniformly vicious but critically differs between specific subtypes of materialism. That is, valuing possessions as a happiness medicine or as a success measure increased loneliness, and these subtypes also increased most due to loneliness. Yet seeking possessions for material mirth decreased loneliness and was unaffected by it. These findings are based on longitudinal data from over 2,500 consumers across 6 years and a new latent growth model.

The influence of interannual variations of absorbing aerosols over the Indo-Gangetic Plain in May on the Indian summer monsoon is characterized by means of an observational analysis. Insight into how the aerosol impact is generated is also provided. It is shown that anomalous aerosol loading in late spring leads to remarkable and large-scale variations in the monsoon evolution. Excessive aerosols in May lead to reduced cloud amount and precipitation, increased surface shortwave radiation, and land surface warming. The June (and July) monsoon anomaly associated with excessive May aerosols is of opposite sign over much of the subcontinent (although with a different pattern) with respect to May. The monsoon strengthens in June (and July). The analysis suggests that the significant large-scale aerosol influence on monsoon circulation and hydroclimate is mediated by the heating of the land surface, pursuant to reduced cloudiness and precipitation in May. The finding of the significant role of the land surface in the realization of the aerosol impact is somewhat novel.",https://openalex.org/W2167320030,openalex

The empirical analysis of data collected in Hong Kong is used to elaborate and support two main claims. The first is that geography matters to not only overall well-being but also momentary well-being and that researchers should be careful to specify the influence of geographical context correctly. We therefore employ an approach that is informed by various strands of time–geographical thought and find that life satisfaction is associated more strongly with geographical context than is momentary well-being. Second, we confirm positive relations between social contacts and experienced well-being but extend earlier research by showing that these relations stretch across multiple timescales and depend to some extent on the duration of an activity episode and with whom the activity episode is undertaken. This means that the use of simple indicators of social capital is inadequate for making the complex linkages between well-being and people's social contacts understandable in empirical research.",https://openalex.org/W1977399607,openalex

However, existing technical solutions are narrow in scope and have been primarily directed towards algorithms for scoring or classification tasks, with an emphasis on fairness and unwanted bias. To build long-lasting trust between AI and human beings, we argue that the key is to think beyond algorithmic fairness and connect major aspects of AI that potentially cause AI’s indifferent behavior.

The topic is important because both school and district policies can influence teachers’ propensity to be absent. The authors estimate the impact of teacher absences on academic achievement of students matched to elementary school teachers. Models include fixed effects for teachers to control statistically for potential correlation between time-invariant levels of teachers’ skill and effort and their rates of absence. The authors estimate 10 additional days of teacher absence reduce mathematics achievement of fourth-grade students by 3.2% of a standard deviation. They employ an additional instrumental variables strategy to bolster the case for a causal interpretation of results. Instrumental variables results indicate the impact of unexpected teacher absences on student achievement is larger than the impact of anticipated absences.,https://openalex.org/W2110147342,openalex

In 2016, the residential energy consumption amounted to 25.71% of the EU’s final energy consumption, representing the second largest consuming sector after transport. Consumption-related data are discussed together with data on some main energy efficiency policies and energy consumption determinants, such as economic and population growth, weather conditions, and household and building characteristics. Indicators are identified to show the impact of specific determinants on energy consumption and a new indicator is proposed, drawing a closer link between energy trends and policy and technological changes in the sector. The analysis of these determinants highlights the complex dynamics behind the demand of energy in the residential sector. Decomposition analysis is carried out using the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index technique to provide a more complete picture of the impact of various determinants (population, wealth, intensity, and weather) on the latest EU-28 residential energy consumption trends.

Proctor,2020.0,,"Significance There is interest in whether COVID-19 cases respond to environmental conditions. If an effect is present, seasonal changes in local environmental conditions could alter the global spatial pattern of COVID-19 and inform local public health responses. Using a comprehensive global dataset of daily COVID-19 cases and local environmental conditions, we find that increased daily ultraviolet (UV) radiation lowers the cumulative daily growth rate of COVID-19 cases over the subsequent 2.5 wk. Although statistically significant, the implied influence of UV seasonality is modest relative to social distancing policies. Temperature and specific humidity cumulative effects are not statistically significant, and total COVID-19 seasonality remains to be established because of uncertainty in the net effects from seasonally varying environmental variables.",https://openalex.org/W3113001290,openalex
A881,Bringing physical reasoning into statistical practice in climate-change science,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-021-03226-6,Theodore G. Shepherd,2021.0,,"Abstract The treatment of uncertainty in climate-change science is dominated by the far-reaching influence of the ‘frequentist’ tradition in statistics, which interprets uncertainty in terms of sampling statistics and emphasizes p -values and statistical significance. This is the normative standard in the journals where most climate-change science is published. Yet a sampling distribution is not always meaningful (there is only one planet Earth). Moreover, scientific statements about climate change are hypotheses, and the frequentist tradition has no way of expressing the uncertainty of a hypothesis. As a result, in climate-change science, there is generally a disconnect between physical reasoning and statistical practice. This paper explores how the frequentist statistical methods used in climate-change science can be embedded within the more general framework of probability theory, which is based on very simple logical principles. In this way, the physical reasoning represented in scientific hypotheses, which underpins climate-change science, can be brought into statistical practice in a transparent and logically rigorous way. The principles are illustrated through three examples of controversial scientific topics: the alleged global warming hiatus, Arctic-midlatitude linkages, and extreme event attribution. These examples show how the principles can be applied, in order to develop better scientific practice. “La théorie des probabilités n’est que le bon sens reduit au calcul.” (Pierre-Simon Laplace, Essai Philosophiques sur les Probabilités , 1819). “It is sometimes considered a paradox that the answer depends not only on the observations but on the question; it should be a platitude.” (Harold Jeffreys, Theory of Probability , 1st edition, 1939).",https://openalex.org/W3202323101,openalex

Wilkinson,1990.0,,"Abstract This paper starts out from the striking tendency for life expectancy to be highest in those developed countries where income is distributed most equally, rather than in those which are richest. It goes on to discuss the shape of the relationship between income and health which this implies within nations. After reproducing evidence from the Health and Lifestyles Survey of a cross‐sectional relationship in Britain which is consistent with the international picture, the paper then reports on a test of the causality of that relationship. The test compared the changes between 1971 and 1981 in the position of occupations in the‘earnings league’with changes in their position in the occupational mortality league in Britain. The analysis found that changes in mortality were significantly, positively and independently related to changes in the proportion unemployed and the proportion on low relative earnings in each occupation. The percentage change in the size of each occupational group during the decade was used to control for any effects of selection in or out of occupations. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the implications of these findings.",https://openalex.org/W1985776223,openalex

For both weekdays and weekend days, separate multinomial logistic regression models were estimated using three categories of sleep duration as the outcome category.Unmarried individuals are significantly more likely to sleep a short amount on both weekdays and weekends compared to married people. Single people also are significantly more likely to sleep a long amount. People with less than a college education are significantly more likely to sleep both a short amount and a long amount on weekdays relative to the college educated.High-risk sleep durations (short sleeping and long sleeping) are positively associated with sociodemographic categories associated with poorer health.

Demographic data show that living in the Eastern or Western part of Germany offers differential opportunities for contact with foreigners. Structural equation analyses reveal that this difference, in turn, influences the number of foreigners in the neighborhood or classroom. As a consequence of these varying opportunities for contact, respondents report marked differences in more intimate and personal contact—such as having foreign friends or experiencing contact of personal importance. Foreign friends and importance of contact proved to be the relevant proximal contact variables that reduce ethnic prejudice.

King,2020.0,,"Abstract. There is an observed relationship linking Arctic sea ice conditions in autumn to mid-latitude weather the following winter. Of interest in this study is a hypothesized stratospheric pathway whereby reduced sea ice in the Barents and Kara seas enhances upward wave activity and wave-breaking in the stratosphere, leading to a weakening of the polar vortex and a transition of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) to its negative phase. The Causal Effect Networks (CEN) framework is used to explore the stratospheric pathway between late autumn Barents–Kara sea ice and the February NAO, focusing on its seasonal evolution, timescale dependence, and robustness. Results indicate that the pathway is statistically detectable and has been relatively active over the 39-year observational period used here, explaining approximately 26 % of the interannual variability in the February NAO. However, a bootstrap-based resampling test reveals that the pathway is highly intermittent: the full stratospheric pathway appears in only 16 % of the sample populations derived from observations, with individual causal linkages ranging from 46 % to 84 % in occurrence rates. The pathway's intermittency is consistent with the weak signal-to-noise ratio of the atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice variability in modelling experiments and suggests that Arctic–mid-latitude teleconnections might be favoured in certain background states. On shorter timescales, the CEN detects two-way interactions between Barents–Kara sea ice and the mid-latitude circulation that indicate a role for synoptic variability associated with blocking over the Urals region and moist air intrusions from the Euro-Atlantic sector. This synoptic variability has the potential to interfere with the stratospheric pathway, thereby contributing to its intermittency. This study helps quantify the robustness of causal linkages within the stratospheric pathway, and provides insight into which linkages are most subject to sampling issues within the relatively short observational record. Overall, the results should help guide the analysis and design of ensemble modelling experiments required to improve physical understanding of Arctic–mid-latitude teleconnections.",https://openalex.org/W3024157239,openalex

We examine the dynamic relationships for a sample of 49 countries with green bonds issued for the period 2007–2019. The results confirm that there are bidirectional relationships among renewable energy consumption, environmental pollution and climate change. Innovation can significantly promote renewable energy consumption, reduce CO 2 emissions and mitigate climate change. Green finance can effectively alleviate environmental pollution and climate change. Accelerating the development of green finance is the primary motivation for sustainable development. Green finance moderates the relationship between innovation and energy-environment-climate nexus. The positive impact of innovation on renewable energy consumption is enhanced by higher level of green finance.

This focus upon justice is contrasted with the more traditional focus upon the level of outcomes received from the political system and upon congruence in citizen‐leader policy preferences. The results strongly support a focus upon justice by showing that judgments of injustice exercise an influence upon leadership evaluations and in stitutional endorsements which is independent of beliefs about the level of outcomes the political system is providing to citizens or of public support for government policies.

Sociohydrology is the study of coupled human–water systems, building on the premise that water and human systems co-evolve: the state of the water system feeds back onto the human system, and vice versa, a situation denoted as ""two-way coupling"". A recent special issue in HESS/ESD, ""Predictions under change: water, earth, and biota in the Anthropocene"", includes a number of sociohydrologic publications that allow for a survey of the current state of understanding of sociohydrology and the dynamics and feedbacks that couple water and human systems together, of the research methodologies being employed to date, and of the normative and ethical issues raised by the study of sociohydrologic systems. Although sociohydrology is concerned with coupled human–water systems, the feedback may be filtered by a connection through natural or social systems, for example, the health of a fishery or through the global food trade, and therefore it may not always be possible to treat the human–water system in isolation. As part of a larger complex system, sociohydrology can draw on tools developed in the social–ecological and complex systems literature to further our sociohydrologic knowledge, and this is identified as a ripe area of future research.",https://openalex.org/W2081993865,openalex

Anomaly detection in multivariate time series data poses a particular challenge because it requires simultaneous consideration of temporal dependencies and relationships between variables. Recent deep learning-based works have made impressive progress in this field. They are highly capable of learning representations of the large-scaled sequences in an unsupervised manner and identifying anomalies from the data. However, most of them are highly specific to the individual use case and thus require domain knowledge for appropriate deployment. This review provides a background on anomaly detection in time-series data and reviews the latest applications in the real world.

The last section of the paper addresses problems associated with making causal inferences in cross-national research. This involves a comparison of cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, a discussion of measurement validity, and a consideration of the fact that empirical research seldom offers a full, direct test of a theory.

But the foundation of systems thinking and system dynamics lies deeper than these and is often implicit or even ignored: it is the “endogenous point of view”. The paper begins with historical background, clarifies the endogenous point of view, illustrates with examples, and argues that the endogenous point of view is the sine qua non of systems approaches.

These constraints-the room for maneuver-are shaped by the degree of social cohesion in a country and the quality of its institutions. Social cohesion-that is, the inclusiveness of a country's communities-is essential for generating the trust needed to implement reforms. Citizens have to trust that the short-term losses that inevitably arise from reform will be more than offset by long-term gains. However, in countries divided along class and ethnic lines and with weak institutions, even the boldest, most civic-minded and well-informed politician (or interest group) will face severe constraints in bringing about policy reform. Ritzen, Easterly, and Woolcock hypothesize that key development outcomes (particularly economic growth) are more likely to be associated with countries that are both socially cohesive and governed by effective public institutions. They test this hypothesis for the sample of countries with available data. The authors develop a conceptual framework based on the idea of social cohesion, then review the evidence on which it is based. While several earlier studies have shown that differences in growth rates among developing countries are a result of weak rule of law, lack of democracy, and other institutional deficiencies, Ritzen, Easterly, and Woolcock focus on the social conditions that give rise to these deficiencies. They also seek to establish empirically a causal sequence from social divisions to weak institutions to slow growth. The essence of their argument, supported by new econometric evidence, is that pro-development policies are comparatively rare in the developing world less because of the moral fiber of politicians (though that surely matters) than because good politicians typically lack the room for maneuver needed to make desired reforms. This lack of maneuverability is a product of insufficient social cohesion and weak institutions. The authors also explore the determinants of social cohesion, focusing on historical accidents, initial conditions, and natural resource endowments. Social cohesion should not be seen as a concern primarily of developing and transition economies. Indeed, it is as important in the United Kingdom as in Ukraine, in Canada as in Colombia, in the Netherlands as in Nigeria.

Patil,2006.0,,"Abstract Food insecurity is a major health problem that has pervasive effects on many human biological outcomes. In particular, there are compelling theoretical and empirical reasons to expect that the relationship between food insecurity may be directly related to mental health morbidities, and may be quantifiable in developing country settings. This preliminary study examined whether caretaker reports of food insecurity were associated with anxiety and depression among four ethnic groups in two communities of rural Tanzania. In‐home interviews were conducted in June–August of 2005 among female caretakers (n = 449). In addition to collecting household and demographic data, modified versions of the USDA's food security module and Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) were used to measure food insecurity and anxiety and depression. Consistent with predictions, the results showed a strong positive correlation between a caretaker's score on the food insecurity instrument and her summed response on the HSCL ( P &lt; 0.0001). This association was maintained in all four ethnic groups, even when controlling for individual‐level covariates such as caretaker's age and marital status. Issues of causality and hypotheses that might explain this robust finding are discussed, as are methodological and theoretical implications. Am. J. Hum.

We rely on an original instrumental variable approach on the basis of the idea that workers perceive greater job security in countries where employment is strongly protected by the law and more so if employed in industries where employment protection legislation is more binding; that is, in induastries with a higher natural rate of dismissals. Using cross‐country data from the 2010 European Working Conditions Survey, we show that, when the potential endogeneity of job insecurity is not accounted for, the latter appears to deteriorate almost all health outcomes. When tackling the endogeneity issue by estimating an instrumental variable model and dealing with potential weak‐instrument issues, the health‐damaging effect of job insecurity is confirmed for a limited subgroup of health outcomes; namely, suffering from headaches or eyestrain and skin problems. As for other health variables, the impact of job insecurity appears to be insignificant at conventional levels. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",https://openalex.org/W1844631438,openalex

A significant surface air temperature trend of −0.3°C decade −1 in this area during the period 1983–2006 is first time reported here. This local cooling trend shows no correlation with Spanish regional and global warming trends. Radiative forcing (RF) is widely used to assess and compare the climate change mechanisms. Surface shortwave RF (SWRF) caused through clearing of pasture land for greenhouse farming development in this area is estimated here. We present the first empirical evidences to support the working hypothesis of the development of a localized forcing created by surface albedo change to explain the differences in temperature trends among stations either inside or far from this agricultural land. SWRF was estimated from satellite‐retrieved surface albedo data and calculated shortwave outgoing fluxes associated with either uses of land under typical incoming solar radiation. Outgoing fluxes were calculated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data. A difference in mean annual surface albedo of +0.09 was measured comparing greenhouses surface to a typical pasture land. Strong negative forcing associated with land use change was estimated all year round, ranging from −5.0 W m −2 to −34.8 W m −2 , with a mean annual value of −19.8 W m −2 .

The authors show that a leading pattern of extratropical variability, whose sea level pressure footprint is the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) and circulation footprint the West Pacific (WP) teleconnection—together, the NPO–WP—exhibited extreme and persistent amplitude in this winter. Reconstruction of the 850-hPa temperature, 200-hPa geopotential height, and precipitation reveals that the NPO–WP was the leading contributor to the winter climate anomaly over large swaths of North America. This analysis, furthermore, indicates that NPO–WP variability explains the most variance of monthly winter temperature over central-eastern North America since, at least, 1979. Analysis of the NPO–WP related thermal advection provides physical insight on the generation of the cold temperature anomalies over North America. Although NPO–WP’s origin and development remain to be elucidated, its concurrent links to tropical SSTs are tenuous. These findings suggest that notable winter climate anomalies in the Pacific–North American sector need not originate, directly, from the tropics. More broadly, the attribution of the severe 2013/14 winter to the flexing of an extratropical variability pattern is cautionary given the propensity to implicate the tropics, following several decades of focus on El Niño–Southern Oscillation and its regional and far-field impacts.",https://openalex.org/W1805458330,openalex

They found that cultural products that come from Western cultures (mostly the United States) are more individualistic, and less collectivistic, than cultural products that come from collectivistic cultures (including Korea, Japan, China, and Mexico). The effect sizes for cultural products were larger than self-report effect sizes for this dimension (reported in Oyserman, Coon, & Kemmelmeier, 2002). In addition to presenting this evidence, the authors highlight the importance of studying the dynamic relationships between sociocultural environments and psyches.",https://openalex.org/W2104035985,openalex

Carey,2006.0,,"This study contributes to our understanding of the dynamic relationship between protest and repression. It employs vector autoregressions to analyze daily data from six Latin American and three African countries from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. The results suggest that there is a reciprocal relationship between protest and repression and that protest is consistent over time. Democracies were found to be most likely to accommodate the opposition and, at the same time, were least likely to display continuous repressive behavior. However, if faced with popular dissent, democracies were just as likely to respond with negative sanctions as other regime types, whereas negative sanctions were particularly unsuccessful to solicit dissident cooperation in democracies.",https://openalex.org/W2090732629,openalex

To account for such feedbacks, we implemented a novel plant individual-based vegetation dynamics-ecosystem biogeochemistry scheme within the RCA3 RCM. Variations in leaf area index (LAI) of seven plant functional type (PFTs) in response to physical forcing and evolving vegetation state feed back to climate via adjustments in surface energy fluxes and surface properties. In an ERA-40-driven simulation over Europe, the model reproduces the recent past climate with comparable accuracy to the standard RCM. Large-scale patterns of LAI, net primary production and vegetation composition were comparable with observations, although winter LAI was systematically overestimated compared to satellite estimates. Analysis of the ERA-40 simulation and an A1B climate-change simulation revealed considerable covariation among dynamic variables of the physical climate and vegetation. At a Mediterranean site, periodic soil water limitation led to fluctuations in leaf cover and a likely positive feedback to near-surface temperature. At an alpine site, rising temperatures led to forest advance onto tundra areas, reducing albedo and effecting a likely positive feedback on temperature. Climate—vegetation coupling was less pronounced but still apparent at intermediate temperate and boreal sites.",https://openalex.org/W2155340236,openalex

However, the link between crime and air pollution has been largely overlooked. In this paper we study whether exposure to ambient air pollution affects crime using daily administrative data for London in 2004–5. For identification, we estimate models with ward fixed effects and implement two instrumental variable strategies, using atmospheric inversions and wind direction as exogenous shocks to local pollution. We find that air pollution has a positive and statistically significant impact on overall crime and on several major crime categories, including those with economic motives. Importantly, the effect also occurs at pollution levels that are well below current regulatory standards and appears to be unevenly distributed across income groups. Our results suggest that reducing air pollution in urban areas may be an effective measure to reduce crime and that air pollution forecasts can be used to improve predictive policing.",https://openalex.org/W2904426259,openalex

Reid; Peng Xian; E. J. Hyer; Maria Flatau; Ellen Ramirez; F. Joseph Turk; Charles R. Sampson; C. Zhang; Edward M. Fukada; Eric D. Maloney,2012.0,,"Abstract. Much research and speculation exists about the meteorological and climatological impacts of biomass burning in the Maritime Continent (MC) of Indonesia and Malaysia, particularly during El Nino events. However, the MC hosts some of the world's most complicated meteorology, and we wish to understand how tropical phenomena at a range of scales influence observed burning activity. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived active fire hotspot patterns coupled with aerosol data assimilation products, satellite based precipitation, and meteorological indices, the meteorological context of observed fire prevalence and smoke optical depth in the MC are examined. Relationships of burning and smoke transport to such meteorological and climatic factors as the interannual El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), El Nino Modoki, Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), the seasonal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, the 30–90 day Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), tropical waves, tropical cyclone activity, and diurnal convection were investigated. A conceptual model of how all of the differing meteorological scales affect fire activity is presented. Each island and its internal geography have different sensitivities to these factors which are likely relatable to precipitation patterns and land use practices. At the broadest scales as previously reported, we corroborate ENSO is indeed the largest factor. However, burning is also enhanced by periods of El Nino Modoki. Conversely, IOD influences are unclear. While interannual phenomena correlate to total seasonal burning, the MJO largely controls when visible burning occurs. High frequency phenomena which are poorly constrained in models such as diurnal convection and tropical cyclone activity also have an impact which cannot be ignored. Finally, we emphasize that these phenomena not only influence burning, but also the observability of burning, further complicating our ability to assign reasonable emissions.",https://openalex.org/W2071123370,openalex

This framework is based on a combination of natural hazards theory and interactions with a variety of drought planners in the field, and is intended to be a practical, action-oriented model to assist drought planners on a variety of political and geographic scales.

The results showed that both the state and trait components of strains were affected by stressors.

Smit; Jentien M. Vermeulen; Gita A. Pathak; Renato Polimanti; Karin J. H. Verweij; Jorien L. Treur,2024.0,,"ABSTRACT Background and Aims Experiencing a traumatic event may lead to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), including symptoms such as flashbacks and hyperarousal. Individuals suffering from PTSD are at increased risk of cardiovascu-lar disease (CVD), but it is unclear why. This study assesses shared genetic liability and potential causal pathways between PTSD and CVD. Methods We leveraged summary-level data of genome-wide association studies (PTSD: N= 1,222,882; atrial fibril-lation (AF): N=482,409; coronary artery disease (CAD): N=1,165,690; hypertension: N=458,554; heart failure (HF): N=977,323). First, we estimated genetic correlations and utilized genomic structural equation modeling to identify a common genetic factor for PTSD and CVD. Next, we assessed biological, behavioural, and psychosocial factors as potential mediators. Finally, we employed multivariable Mendelian randomiza-tion to examine causal pathways between PTSD and CVD, incorporating the same potential mediators. Results Significant genetic correlations were found between PTSD and CAD, HT, and HF ( r g =0.21-0.32, p ≤ 3.08 · 10* 16 ), but not between PTSD and AF. Insomnia, smoking, alcohol dependence, waist-to-hip ratio, and inflammation (IL6, C-reactive protein) partly mediated these associations. Mendelian randomization indicated that PTSD causally increases CAD (IVW OR=1.53, 95% CIs=1.19-1.96, p=0.001), HF (OR=1.44, CIs=1.08-1.92, p=0.012), and to a lesser degree hypertension (OR=1.25, CIs=1.05-1.49, p=0.012). While insomnia, smoking, alcohol, and inflammation were important mediators, independent causal effects also remained. Conclusions In addition to shared genetic liability between PTSD and CVD, we present strong evidence for causal effects of PTSD on CVD. Crucially, we implicate specific lifestyle and biological mediators (insomnia, substance use, inflammation) which has important implications for interventions to prevent CVD in PTSD patients. Translational perspective The significant mental and physical strain experienced by patients suffering from Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remains a domain necessitating further insight for the development of effective intervention strategies. Our study elucidates the complex genetic architecture that underlies the relationship between PTSD and cardiovascular disease. We present evidence supporting a causal link from PTSD to coronary artery disease and heart failure. Further, we identify various mediators of this causality, including inflammatory markers, substance use, waist-to-hip ratio and sleep deprivation. Our work calls for tar-geted preventive and therapeutic approaches to reduce the dual burden of mental and physical disease in PTSD patients.",https://openalex.org/W4392974697,openalex

Previously, such multiscale approaches bypassed the mesoscale processes of the mountain-induced atmospheric flow, by statistical transfer functions or subgrid parameterizations, and included simplified glacier mass balance (MB) models. Here we show, on the basis of Kilimanjaro (East Africa) as a test case, that a limited area atmospheric model (LAM) and a process-resolving MB model can be linked without statistical corrections at their interface. This is evident from robust energy and MB patterns at the glacier surface, regardless of whether the MB model is forced by (1) in situ meteorological measurements or (2) uncorrected output from the high-resolution LAM grid over the glacier area. The latter is achieved by multiple grid nesting in the land-atmosphere-ocean domain of the LAM. Since this setup resolves the mesoscale process space, we also show the potential to increase knowledge of how dynamical, thermodynamic, and microphysical phenomena of the mountain-induced flow affect glacier MB. All these results are encouraging for future research because they demonstrate that a dynamical system, which operates on very different space-time scales, can be quantified in a fully physical way, if dynamic meteorology and glaciology are exploited in a complementary sense. This will enhance the process understanding of forward problems (glacier response to climate forcing) and backward problems (climate signal extraction from past extents of mountain glaciers).",https://openalex.org/W2061000793,openalex

This has been challenged by those who favour broader criteria, such as fulfilment of 'basic needs' and the 'capabilities' to be and to do things of intrinsic worth. This paper asks: to what extent are these different concepts measurable, to what extent are they competing or complementary, and is it possible for them to be accommodated within an encompassing framework? We conclude that it is possible to view subjective well-being as an encompassing concept, which permits us to quantify the relevance and importance of the other approaches and of their component variables. Any attempt to define poverty involves a value judgment as to what constitutes a good quality of life or a bad one. We argue that an approach which examines the individual's own perception of well-being is less imperfect, or more quantifiable, or both, as a guide to forming that value judgement than are the other potential approaches.

In this study, we have used maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT), wavelet covariance, wavelet correlation, continuous wavelet power spectrum, wavelet coherence spectrum and wavelet-based Granger causality analysis to analyse the relationship between TD and CO2 emission in the United States by using the monthly data from the period of 1996(1) to 2015(3). Results indicate that TD is majorly having the positive influence over CE in short, medium and long run. We find the unidirectional influence of TD on CE in short run, medium and long run in the United States.",https://openalex.org/W2417695567,openalex
A934,A Time-Varying Causality Formalism Based on the Liang–Kleeman Information Flow for Analyzing Directed Interactions in Nonstationary Climate Systems,https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-18-0881.1,Daniel Fiifi Tawia Hagan; Guojie Wang; X. San Liang; A. J. Dolman,2019.0,,"Abstract The interaction between the land surface and the atmosphere is of significant importance in the climate system because it is a key driver of the exchanges of energy and water. Several important relations to heat waves, floods, and droughts exist that are based on the interaction of soil moisture and, for instance, air temperature and humidity. Our ability to separate the elements of this coupling, identify the exact locations where they are strongest, and quantify their strengths is, therefore, of paramount importance to their predictability. A recent rigorous causality formalism based on the Liang–Kleeman (LK) information flow theory has been shown, both theoretically and in real-world applications, to have the necessary asymmetry to infer the directionality and magnitude within geophysical interactions. However, the formalism assumes stationarity in time, whereas the interactions within the land surface and atmosphere are generally nonstationary; furthermore, it requires a sufficiently long time series to ensure statistical sufficiency. In this study, we remedy this difficulty by using the square root Kalman filter to estimate the causality based on the LK formalism to derive a time-varying form. Results show that the new formalism has similar properties compared to its time-invariant form. It is shown that it is also able to capture the time-varying causality structure within soil moisture–air temperature coupling. An advantage is that it does not require very long time series to make an accurate estimation. Applying a wavelet transform to the results also reveals the full range of temporal scales of the interactions.",https://openalex.org/W2966817232,openalex

Scaife,2019.0,,"Abstract The stratosphere contains ~17% of Earth’s atmospheric mass, but its existence was unknown until 1902. In the following decades our knowledge grew gradually as more observations of the stratosphere were made. In 1913 the ozone layer, which protects life from harmful ultraviolet radiation, was discovered. From ozone and water vapor observations, a first basic idea of a stratospheric general circulation was put forward. Since the 1950s our knowledge of the stratosphere and mesosphere has expanded rapidly, and the importance of this region in the climate system has become clear. With more observations, several new stratospheric phenomena have been discovered: the quasi-biennial oscillation, sudden stratospheric warmings, the Southern Hemisphere ozone hole, and surface weather impacts of stratospheric variability. None of these phenomena were anticipated by theory. Advances in theory have more often than not been prompted by unexplained phenomena seen in new stratospheric observations. From the 1960s onward, the importance of dynamical processes and the coupled stratosphere–troposphere circulation was realized. Since approximately 2000, better representations of the stratosphere—and even the mesosphere—have been included in climate and weather forecasting models. We now know that in order to produce accurate seasonal weather forecasts, and to predict long-term changes in climate and the future evolution of the ozone layer, models with a well-resolved stratosphere with realistic dynamics and chemistry are necessary.",https://openalex.org/W2980421467,openalex

This article explores one explanation for such gaps: income segregation between school districts, which creates inequality in the economic and social resources available in advantaged and disadvantaged students’ school contexts. Drawing on national data, I find that the income achievement gap is larger in highly segregated metropolitan areas. This is due mainly to high-income students performing better, rather than low-income children performing worse, in more-segregated places. Income segregation between districts also contributes to the racial achievement gap, largely because white students perform better in more economically segregated places. Descriptive portraits of the school districts of high- and low-income students show that income segregation creates affluent districts for high-income students while changing the contexts of low-income students negligibly. Considering income and race jointly, I find that only high-income white families live in the affluent districts created by income segregation; black families with identically high incomes live in districts more similar to those of low-income white families. My results demonstrate that the spatial inequalities created by income segregation between school districts contribute to achievement gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students, with implications for future research and policy.",https://openalex.org/W2767736630,openalex
A938,ATTRICI v1.1 – counterfactual climate for impact attribution,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5269-2021,Matthias Mengel; Simon Treu; Stefan Lange; Katja Frieler,2021.0,,"Abstract. Attribution in its general definition aims to quantify drivers of change in a system. According to IPCC Working Group II (WGII) a change in a natural, human or managed system is attributed to climate change by quantifying the difference between the observed state of the system and a counterfactual baseline that characterizes the system's behavior in the absence of climate change, where “climate change refers to any long-term trend in climate, irrespective of its cause” (IPCC, 2014). Impact attribution following this definition remains a challenge because the counterfactual baseline, which characterizes the system behavior in the hypothetical absence of climate change, cannot be observed. Process-based and empirical impact models can fill this gap as they allow us to simulate the counterfactual climate impact baseline. In those simulations, the models are forced by observed direct (human) drivers such as land use changes, changes in water or agricultural management but a counterfactual climate without long-term changes. We here present ATTRICI (ATTRIbuting Climate Impacts), an approach to construct the required counterfactual stationary climate data from observational (factual) climate data. Our method identifies the long-term shifts in the considered daily climate variables that are correlated to global mean temperature change assuming a smooth annual cycle of the associated scaling coefficients for each day of the year. The produced counterfactual climate datasets are used as forcing data within the impact attribution setup of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP3a). Our method preserves the internal variability of the observed data in the sense that factual and counterfactual data for a given day have the same rank in their respective statistical distributions. The associated impact model simulations allow for quantifying the contribution of climate change to observed long-term changes in impact indicators and for quantifying the contribution of the observed trend in climate to the magnitude of individual impact events. Attribution of climate impacts to anthropogenic forcing would need an additional step separating anthropogenic climate forcing from other sources of climate trends, which is not covered by our method.",https://openalex.org/W3092205005,openalex

Manyong,2017.0,,"This study measured the impacts of drought tolerant maize varieties (DTMVs) on productivity, welfare, and risk exposure using household and plot-level data from rural Nigeria. The study employed an endogenous switching regression approach to control for both observed and unobserved sources of heterogeneity between adopters and non-adopters. Our results showed that adoption of DTMVs increased maize yields by 13.3% and reduced the level of variance by 53% and downside risk exposure by 81% among adopters. This suggests that adoption had a ""win-win"" outcome by increasing maize yields and reducing exposure to drought risk. The gains in productivity and risk reduction due to adoption led to a reduction of 12.9% in the incidence of poverty and of 83.8% in the probability of food scarcity among adopters. The paper concluded that adoption of DTMVs was not just a simple coping strategy against drought but also a productivity enhancing and welfare improving strategy. The results point to the need for policies and programs aimed at enhancing adoption as an adaptation strategy to drought stress in Nigeria and beyond.",https://openalex.org/W2742953941,openalex

Lockwood; Ed Hawkins; Ilya Usoskin; Gareth S. Jones; Luke Barnard; Andrew Schurer; John Fasullo,2017.0,,"The Maunder minimum (MM) was a period of extremely low solar activity from approximately AD 1650 to 1715. In the solar physics literature, the MM is sometimes associated with a period of cooler global temperatures, referred to as the Little Ice Age (LIA), and thus taken as compelling evidence of a large, direct solar influence on climate. In this study, we bring together existing simulation and observational studies, particularly the most recent solar activity and paleoclimate reconstructions, to examine this relation. Using northern hemisphere surface air temperature reconstructions, the LIA can be most readily defined as an approximately 480 year period spanning AD 1440–1920, although not all of this period was notably cold. While the MM occurred within the much longer LIA period, the timing of the features are not suggestive of causation and should not, in isolation, be used as evidence of significant solar forcing of climate. Climate model simulations suggest multiple factors, particularly volcanic activity, were crucial for causing the cooler temperatures in the northern hemisphere during the LIA. A reduction in total solar irradiance likely contributed to the LIA at a level comparable to changing land use.",https://openalex.org/W2774328673,openalex

HFRS is caused by hantaviruses, mainly Seoul virus in urban areas and Hantaan virus in agricultural areas. Although preventive measures including vaccination programs and rodent control measures have resulted in a decline in cases in recent years, there has been an increase in incidence in some areas and new endemic areas have emerged. This review summarises the recent literature relating to the effects of climatic factors on the incidence of HFRS in China and discusses future research directions. Temperature, precipitation and humidity affect crop yields, rodent breeding patterns and disease transmission, and these can be influenced by a changing climate. Detailed surveillance of infections caused by Hantaan and Seoul viruses and further research on the viral agents will aid in interpretation of spatiotemporal patterns and a better understanding of the environmental and ecological drivers of HFRS amid China's rapidly urbanising landscape and changing climate.",https://openalex.org/W2107724144,openalex

Cramer; Annemarie Kalis,2018.0,,"Abstract In the past decades, reductionism has dominated both research directions and funding policies in clinical psychology and psychiatry. The intense search for the biological basis of mental disorders, however, has not resulted in conclusive reductionist explanations of psychopathology. Recently, network models have been proposed as an alternative framework for the analysis of mental disorders, in which mental disorders arise from the causal interplay between symptoms. In this target article, we show that this conceptualization can help explain why reductionist approaches in psychiatry and clinical psychology are on the wrong track. First, symptom networks preclude the identification of a common cause of symptomatology with a neurobiological condition; in symptom networks, there is no such common cause. Second, symptom network relations depend on the content of mental states and, as such, feature intentionality. Third, the strength of network relations is highly likely to depend partially on cultural and historical contexts as well as external mechanisms in the environment. Taken together, these properties suggest that, if mental disorders are indeed networks of causally related symptoms, reductionist accounts cannot achieve the level of success associated with reductionist disease models in modern medicine. As an alternative strategy, we propose to interpret network structures in terms of D. C. Dennett's (1987) notion of real patterns , and suggest that, instead of being reducible to a biological basis, mental disorders feature biological and psychological factors that are deeply intertwined in feedback loops. This suggests that neither psychological nor biological levels can claim causal or explanatory priority, and that a holistic research strategy is necessary for progress in the study of mental disorders.",https://openalex.org/W2735850708,openalex

In this paper, we assess the current distribution of heat exposure within countries, to explore possible distributional consequences of climate change through temperature. Combining survey data from 690,745 households across 52 countries with spatial data on climate, this paper suggests that the welfare impacts of added heat stress may be regressive within countries. We find: (1) a strong negative correlation between household wealth and warmer temperature in many hot countries; (2) a strong positive correlation between household wealth and warmer temperatures in many cold countries; and (3) that poorer individuals are more likely to work in occupations with greater exposure. While our analysis is descriptive rather than causal, our results suggest a larger vulnerability of poor people to heat extremes, and potentially significant distributional and poverty implications of climate change.",https://openalex.org/W3021562645,openalex

Based on historical data for the period of 1977–2005, the empirical results show that both R&amp;D and climate change matter for long‐run productivity growth. The long‐run elasticity of total factor productivity (TFP) with respect to R&amp;D expenditure is 0.497, while that of climate change is 0.506. There is a unidirectional causality running from R&amp;D expenditure to TFP growth in both the short run and long run. Further, the variance decomposition and impulse response function confirm that a significant portion of output and productivity growth beyond the sample period is explained by R&amp;D expenditure. These results justify the increase in R&amp;D investment in the deteriorating climatic condition in the agricultural sector to improve the long‐run prospects of productivity growth.",https://openalex.org/W1579929514,openalex

However, whether the consequences of competition are manifested and measureable on macroevolutionary time scales is equivocal. Marine bivalves and brachiopods have overlapping niches such that competition for food and space may occur. Moreover, there is a long‐standing debate over whether bivalves outcompeted brachiopods evolutionarily, because brachiopod diversity declined through time while bivalve diversity increased. To answer this question, we estimate the origination and extinction dynamics of fossil marine bivalve and brachiopod genera from the Ordovician through to the Recent while simultaneously accounting for incomplete sampling. Then, using stochastic differential equations, we assess statistical relationships among diversification and sampling dynamics of brachiopods and bivalves and five paleoenvironmental proxies. None of these potential environmental drivers had any detectable influence on brachiopod or bivalve diversification. In contrast, elevated bivalve extinction rates causally increased brachiopod origination rates, suggesting that bivalves have suppressed brachiopod evolution.",https://openalex.org/W2121473102,openalex

Wilkinson,1989.0,,"ABSTRACT The official figures which appear to show a widening of class differences in health in England and Wales during the post-war period have been controversial partly because they do not fit with common perceptions of what has happened to differences in the standard of living. As a result, a great deal of effort has gone into investigating suggested weaknesses in the decennial social class mortality data. Though initially plausible, the artifactual and selective explanations of the widening mortality differences which were put forward have not usually been borne out by closer investigations. The only fault in the broad picture presented by the official data which we do perhaps need to bear in mind is the tendency for a narrowing of mortality differentials among younger women to be masked by the widening among older women. This paper is an attempt to look at the other side of the coin—namely, to investigate trends in differences in the standard of living in relation to mortality differentials. It concludes that trends in mortality differences have not been related to trends in class differences in average earnings, but have been fairly clearly related to trends in relative poverty. Relative poverty and class differences in mortality declined before the war but have both increased, decade by decade, since the war. Younger women have perhaps been protected from the increase in relative poverty during much of the post-war period by their increased economic activity rates and the relative improvement in earnings of women in poorly paid manual occupations.",https://openalex.org/W2056227789,openalex

And I suggest that much of the underlying goal of macroecology is the pursuit of general principles and the escape from contingency. I highlight that there are many intertwined aspects of macroecology, with a number of resulting implications.

Typically conceptualized as a private form of violence, most research has focused on individual-level risk markers. Recently, more scholarly attention has been paid to the role that the residential neighborhood environment may play in influencing the occurrence of IPV. With research accumulating since the 1990s, increasing prominence of the topic, and no comprehensive literature reviews yet undertaken, it is time to take stock of what is known, what remains unknown, and the methods and concepts investigators have considered. In this article, we undertake a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature to date on the relationship between neighborhood environment and IPV, asking, “what is the status of scholarship related to the association between neighborhood environment and IPV occurrence?” Although the literature is young, it is receiving increasing attention from researchers in sociology, public health, criminology, and other fields. Obvious gaps in the literature include limited consideration of nonurban areas, limited theoretical motivation, and limited consideration of the range of potential contributors to environmental effects on IPV—such as built environmental factors or access to services. In addition, explanations of the pathways by which place influences the occurrence of IPV draw mainly from social disorganization theory that was developed in urban settings in the United States and may need to be adapted, especially to be useful in explaining residential environmental correlates of IPV in rural or non-U.S. settings. A more complete theoretical understanding of the relationship between neighborhood environment and IPV, especially considering differences among urban, semiurban, and rural settings and developed and developing country settings, will be necessary to advance research questions and improve policy and intervention responses to reduce the burden of IPV.",https://openalex.org/W2093965844,openalex

I argue that labor's collective-action problems, caused by large populations of low-skilled and surplus workers, offset labor's potential political gains from globalization. I show that when the proportion of low-skilled workers in a nation is high, globalization will lead to a decline in welfare spending. Most significantly, the results suggest that in nations where labor-market institutions are not yet well developed, government social-welfare spending is constrained by international market, forces.",https://openalex.org/W2127666958,openalex

First it illustrates and discusses some of the challenges related to the measurement of resilience by reviewing some of the most recently published and grey literature on resilience in relation to food security. Second it proposes a new framework that addresses some of the concerns and limitations of resilience measurement identified in that literature. The main postulate of this framework is that the ‘costs of resilience’ (that is, the different ex‐ante and ex‐post investments, losses, sacrifices, and costs that people have to undertake at individual and collective levels to ‘go through’ a shock or an adverse event) provide an appropriate and independent metric to measure resilience across scales and dimensions. The paper shows how the independent nature of this metrics offers an explanatory power that can be used to infer, in a testable and rigorous manner potential, causalities between the metric and household and/or community characteristics. Empirical and theoretical examples are used throughout the paper to illustrate the arguments.",https://openalex.org/W1999800612,openalex

A review of associations between urban form and long-distance leisure travel,https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aac9d2,Michał Czepkiewicz; Jukka Heinonen; Juudit Ottelin,2018.0,,"Negative relationships between urban density and greenhouse gas emissions from daily travel are well established in the literature. However, recent research suggests that higher urban density is associated with higher emissions from long-distance leisure travel, such as car weekend trips and international flights. This article presents the first systematic review of empirical evidence on these associations and discusses potential explanations. A two-step article selection process yielded 27 empirical articles, complemented by one article published during the review process. When international travel is included in the analysis, the results suggest that residents of the largest cities, and particularly those from centrally located and densely built areas, travel more to cover long distances than do others, after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic variables. When only domestic travel is included, residents of larger settlements and areas of higher density engage in less long-distance travel for leisure purposes than those living in smaller settlements and sparsely built areas. The results of the review are indicative and warrant more research. Generalization is currently limited because of the wide variety of travel behavior measures used, consideration of different travel modes and trip purposes, and geographic scope. There is a strong need for replication of the results using consistent methodology, using data from longer and more recent time spans, and expanding to more diverse geographical settings, especially outside Europe. The systematic review is followed by a narrative review of theoretical explanations of the associations. The most common explanations include: rebound effects, the compensation hypothesis, access to transport infrastructure, urban lifestyles, sociopsychological characteristics, and social networks. Socioeconomic variables are controlled in a majority of the reviewed studies, and business travel is excluded from the review, so the concentration of wealth and business in cities may explain the findings only to some extent. Nonetheless, there is not enough empirical evidence on the causal character of the associations and therefore further qualitative and multidisciplinary work is needed. Compact city and urban densification policies are not strongly challenged by current evidence, and most common policy recommendations point to including air travel into carbon taxing or quota schemes.",https://openalex.org/W2805559684,openalex

A977,Do infant vocabulary skills predict school‐age language and literacy outcomes?,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.12378,Fiona J. Duff; Gurpreet Reen; Kim Plunkett; Kate Nation,2015.0,,"Background Strong associations between infant vocabulary and school‐age language and literacy skills would have important practical and theoretical implications: Preschool assessment of vocabulary skills could be used to identify children at risk of reading and language difficulties, and vocabulary could be viewed as a cognitive foundation for reading. However, evidence to date suggests predictive ability from infant vocabulary to later language and literacy is low. This study provides an investigation into, and interpretation of, the magnitude of such infant to school‐age relationships. Methods Three hundred British infants whose vocabularies were assessed by parent report in the 2nd year of life (between 16 and 24 months) were followed up on average 5 years later (ages ranged from 4 to 9 years), when their vocabulary, phonological and reading skills were measured. Results Structural equation modelling of age‐regressed scores was used to assess the strength of longitudinal relationships. Infant vocabulary (a latent factor of receptive and expressive vocabulary) was a statistically significant predictor of later vocabulary, phonological awareness, reading accuracy and reading comprehension (accounting for between 4% and 18% of variance). Family risk for language or literacy difficulties explained additional variance in reading (approximately 10%) but not language outcomes. Conclusions Significant longitudinal relationships between preliteracy vocabulary knowledge and subsequent reading support the theory that vocabulary is a cognitive foundation of both reading accuracy and reading comprehension. Importantly however, the stability of vocabulary skills from infancy to later childhood is too low to be sufficiently predictive of language outcomes at an individual level – a finding that fits well with the observation that the majority of ‘late talkers’ resolve their early language difficulties. For reading outcomes, prediction of future difficulties is likely to be improved when considering family history of language/literacy difficulties alongside infant vocabulary levels.",https://openalex.org/W2145476850,openalex

Therefore the resources that might reduce its negative outcomes on well-being and job attitudes come into focus. Our study contributes to the work–family conflict literature by exploring the indirect (moderator) and direct role of three work- and organization-related resources, i.e., job control, family supportive climate, organization-based self-esteem (OBSE), in the work-to-family conflict and well-being/job attitude relationship. Theoretically, the study tested the recently developed Job Demands–Resources (JD-R) model in the Scandinavian context. Data for the study were gathered from three differing Finnish organizations (health care district, ICT company, Cardboard mill; n=1252). In line with the predictions of the JD-R model, job demands (time- and strain-based work-to-family conflict) were more robustly associated with strain-based outcomes (physical symptoms), whereas job resources (job control, family supportive climate, OBSE) were more strongly linked to motivational-based outcomes (job satisfaction, organizational commitment). Both job control and family supportive climate moderated the relationships studied; high job control and family supportive climate buffered against the aversive effects of work-to-family conflict on well-being and job attitudes. These indirect effects also varied in relation to the independent, moderator, and dependent variables. However, OBSE did not operate as a buffering factor, although it showed significant direct effects. From a practical viewpoint, our findings suggest that job control and family supportive climate are resources that help employees to reduce the negative effects related to work–family conflict.",https://openalex.org/W2146608504,openalex

Population growth increases the overall demand for food, while income growth affects consumption patterns. Using annual aggregate data from the World Bank in 2001–2020 and econometric approaches, this research investigates the changes in the growth rates in rural and urban populations and GDP per capita and the prevalence of undernourishment as % of the population in low-income countries, lower-middle-income countries, and upper-middle income countries. The main goal of the study is to convey a deeper understanding by quantifying the impacts of rural and urban population growth as well as GDP per capita growth on the prevalence of undernourishment. The robust regression models showed that the prevalence of undernourishment in these countries was strongly associated with rural and urban population growth. A positive impact of rural population growth on undernutrition was found in all three groups of countries, with the most significant positive effects found in upper-middle-income countries. The negative effect of urban population growth on undernourishment was largest for the upper middle-income countries. Furthermore, fully modified ordinary least squares results revealed that the changes in the prevalence of undernourishment are mostly associated with long-term changes in the rural and urban population growth. The Difference in Difference (DiD) estimation confirmed only the causal effect of rural population growth on the prevalence of undernourishment in the panel of these countries.

Combining geo-spatial data on eight environmental risks and household survey data from 2010–2014 for the case study of Vietnam, this paper shows: (i) at the district level, the incidence of poverty is higher in high risk areas, (ii) at the household level, poorer households face higher environmental risks, (iii) for some risks the relationship with household-level consumption varies between rural and urban areas, and (iv) environmental risks explain consumption differences between households, but less so changes over time. While altogether these analyses cannot establish a causal relationship between environmental risks and poverty, they do indicate that Vietnam's poor are disproportionally exposed.

Findings The empirical results from the structural model suggest that satisfaction (SAT) with the attractiveness, quality, and value provided by the destination positively influenced RVI. Perceived risk did not have the predicted effects on SAT and RVI.

First, we estimate the determinants of improved chickpea adoption using a double hurdle model. We apply a control function approach with correlated random effects to control for possible endogeneity resulting from access to improved seed and technology transfer activities. To instrument for these variables we develop novel distance weighted measures of a household's neighbours' access to improved seed and technology transfer activities. Second, we estimate the impact of area under improved chickpea cultivation on household income and poverty. We apply a fixed effects instrumental variables approach where we use the predicted area under cultivation from the double hurdle model as an instrument for observed area under cultivation. We find that improved chickpea adoption significantly increases household income while also reducing household poverty. Finally, we disaggregate results by landholding to explore whether the impact of adoption has heterogeneous effects. Adoption favoured all but the largest landholders, for who the new technology did not have a significant impact on income. Overall, increasing access to improved chickpea appears a promising pathway for rural development in Ethiopia's chickpea growing regions.",https://openalex.org/W2528267702,openalex

In the Nordic region, some of these hazards are projected to change their frequency and intensity in the future, while at the same time strong increases are projected in the proportion of elderly in the population. This paper reports results from three projects studying the potential impacts of climate change on elderly people in the Nordic region. An interactive web-based tool has been developed for mapping and combining indicators of climate change vulnerability of the elderly, by municipality, across three Nordic countries: Finland, Norway and Sweden. The tool can also be used for projecting temperature-related mortality in Finland under different projections of future climate. The approach to vulnerability mapping differs from most previous studies in which researchers selected the indicators to combine into an index. Here, while researchers compile data on indicators that can be accessed in the mapping tool, the onus is on the users of the tool to decide which indicators are of interest and whether to map them individually or as combined indices. Stakeholders with responsibility for the care and welfare of the elderly were engaged in the study through interviews and a workshop. They affirmed the usefulness of the prototype mapping tool for raising awareness about climate change as a potential risk factor for the elderly and offered suggestions on potential refinements, which have now been implemented. These included adding background information on possible adaptation measures for ameliorating the impacts of extreme temperatures, and improved representation of uncertainties in projections of future exposure and adaptive capacity.",https://openalex.org/W2092377435,openalex

This paper turns to U.S. county data on land inequality over the period 1890 to 1930 to help address this fundamental question in political economy. Redistributive policy was primarily decided at the local level during this period, making county-level data particularly informative. Examining within-state variation also reduces the potential impact of latent institutional and political variables. The paper also uses a variety of identification strategies, including historic variables as well as county weather and crop characteristics, as instruments for land inequality. The evidence consistently suggests that greater inequality is significantly associated with less redistribution. This negative relationship is especially large in heavily rural counties, where concentrated landownership implied that landed elites also controlled the majority of economic production.",https://openalex.org/W3124903304,openalex

While physical knowledge about the involved mechanisms is often available, how to quantify a particular causal pathway from data are usually unclear. Here, we argue for adopting a causal inference-based framework in the statistical analysis of teleconnections to overcome this challenge. A causal approach requires explicitly including expert knowledge in the statistical analysis, which allows one to draw quantitative conclusions. We illustrate some of the key concepts of this theory with concrete examples of well-known atmospheric teleconnections. We further discuss the particular challenges and advantages these imply for climate science and argue that a systematic causal approach to statistical inference should become standard practice in the study of teleconnections.",https://openalex.org/W3186069906,openalex

The study exploits time-series data from 1961 to 2014 and further applies descriptive statistical analysis, unit root test, Johansen co-integration test, autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model and pairwise Granger causality test. The study employes augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) and Phillips–Perron (PP) tests to check the stationarity of the variables. The results of the analysis reveal that there is both short- and long-run association between agricultural production, economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions in the country. The long-run results estimate that there is a positive and insignificant association between carbon dioxide emissions, land under cereal crops, and agriculture value-added. The results of the short-run analysis point out that there is a negative and statistically insignificant association between carbon dioxide emissions and gross domestic product. It is very important for the Government of Pakistan’s policymakers to build up agricultural policies, strategies and planning in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

The destruction of the environment presents a serious threat to human existence. South Africa, like several nations, has been working on reducing its dependence on fossil fuels such as coal by utilizing modern energy-efficient technologies that allow to establish a more carbon-neutral economy. Several attempts have been made to identify the major sources of environmental deterioration. Within the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) framework from 1960 to 2020, this study aims to check empirically the effect of fiscal decentralization (FD), green technological innovation (GI), trade openness (OPEN), population size (POP), per capita GDP (GDP), per capita GDP squared (GDP2), institutional quality (INS), and energy consumption (EC) on carbon emissions (CO2) in South Africa, as given its fast economic progress the country is facing problems with CO2 emission. The recently developed novel dynamic autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL)-simulations framework has been used. The outcomes of the analysis indicate that (i) FD, GI, and INS improve environmental sustainability in both the short and long run; (ii) OPEN deteriorates environmental quality in the long run, although it is environmentally friendly in the short run; (iii) per capita GDP increases CO2 emissions, whereas its square contributes to lower it, thus validating the presence of an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis; (iii) POP and EC contribute to environmental deterioration in both the short and long run; and (iv) FD, GI, OPEN, POP, GDP, GDP2, INS, and EC Granger cause CO2 in the medium, long, and short run, suggesting that these variables are important to influence environmental sustainability. In light of our empirical evidence, this paper suggests that the international teamwork necessary to lessen carbon emissions is immensely critical to solve the growing trans-boundary environmental decay and other associated spillover consequences. Moreover, it is important to explain responsibilities at different tiers of government to effectively meet the objectives of low CO2 emissions and energy-saving fiscal expenditure functions.",https://openalex.org/W4293817138,openalex

The long-run relationship between global warming and urbanization is also conditional upon country-specific conditions. This long-run association is especially relevant in poorer and more agriculture-dependent countries with an urban bias as well as in initially non-urban countries in hotter climate zones. We also provide suggestive evidence that warming contributes to losses in agricultural productivity and to pro-urban shifts in public goods provision and that the global warming-urbanization nexus is partly mediated through these channels. Consequently, we argue that the estimated long-run relationship between temperature and urbanization partly captures the potential impact of increasing temperatures on urbanization via a rural push (by impairing agriculture) and an urban pull (via an increased demand for public goods primarily supplied in cities).",https://openalex.org/W4298395879,openalex

A possible alternative is to benefit from weather-insensitive synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In many real-world applications, critical decisions are made based on some informative optical or radar features related to items such as water, vegetation or soil. Under cloudy conditions, however, optical-based features are not available, and they are commonly reconstructed through linear interpolation between data available at temporally-close time instants. In this work, we propose to estimate missing optical features through data fusion and deep-learning. Several sources of information are taken into account—optical sequences, SAR sequences, digital elevation model—so as to exploit both temporal and cross-sensor dependencies. Based on these data and a tiny cloud-free fraction of the target image, a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to perform the desired estimation. To validate the proposed approach, we focus on the estimation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), using coupled Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series acquired over an agricultural region of Burkina Faso from May–November 2016. Several fusion schemes are considered, causal and non-causal, single-sensor or joint-sensor, corresponding to different operating conditions.

Mesoscale systems were common south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Trough (ACT) over the coastal oceans of the Indian Ocean sector and in the Ross Sea, while large synoptic systems occurred most frequently in the ACT. A novel technique was applied to study the relationships between cyclone characteristics and surface properties over the Southern Ocean and the coastal areas of Antarctica. Our comprehensive study has revealed that up to half of the cyclones simulated by AMPS correlated with the surface latent heat flux, sensible heat flux, or temperature gradient. These cyclones either modified the surface or were being modified by it. In the former category, 85% of the systems were synoptic cyclones associated predominantly with baroclinicity and advection, and the atmospheric boundary layer had a little influence in the generation and development of cyclones. On the contrary, in the latter category, 36% of the systems were mesoscale cyclones gaining energy from instabilities in the boundary layer associated with strong turbulent fluxes.",https://openalex.org/W2082468718,openalex

The study evaluated whether exposure to anticholinergic drugs was associated with dementia risk in 58 769 patients with a diagnosis of dementia and 225 574 controls 55 years or older matched by age, sex, general practice, and calendar time. Information on prescriptions for 56 drugs with strong anticholinergic properties was used to calculate measures of cumulative anticholinergic drug exposure. Data were analyzed from May 2016 to June 2018.The primary exposure was the total standardized daily doses (TSDDs) of anticholinergic drugs prescribed in the 1 to 11 years prior to the date of diagnosis of dementia or equivalent date in matched controls (index date).Odds ratios (ORs) for dementia associated with cumulative exposure to anticholinergic drugs, adjusted for confounding variables.Of the entire study population (284 343 case patients and matched controls), 179 365 (63.1%) were women, and the mean (SD) age of the entire population was 82.2 (6.8) years. The adjusted OR for dementia increased from 1.06 (95% CI, 1.03-1.09) in the lowest overall anticholinergic exposure category (total exposure of 1-90 TSDDs) to 1.49 (95% CI, 1.44-1.54) in the highest category (>1095 TSDDs), compared with no anticholinergic drug prescriptions in the 1 to 11 years before the index date. There were significant increases in dementia risk for the anticholinergic antidepressants (adjusted OR [AOR], 1.29; 95% CI, 1.24-1.34), antiparkinson drugs (AOR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.16-2.00), antipsychotics (AOR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.53-1.90), bladder antimuscarinic drugs (AOR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.56-1.75), and antiepileptic drugs (AOR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.22-1.57) all for more than 1095 TSDDs. Results were similar when exposures were restricted to exposure windows of 3 to 13 years (AOR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.41-1.52) and 5 to 20 years (AOR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.32-1.57) before the index date for more than 1095 TSDDs. Associations were stronger in cases diagnosed before the age of 80 years. The population-attributable fraction associated with total anticholinergic drug exposure during the 1 to 11 years before diagnosis was 10.3%.Exposure to several types of strong anticholinergic drugs is associated with an increased risk of dementia. These findings highlight the importance of reducing exposure to anticholinergic drugs in middle-aged and older people.",https://openalex.org/W2939971450,openalex

The answer to this simple question is both obvious and complex. Public transit systems carry large shares of person travel in older, larger metropolitan areas around the globe, but in most places, old and new, large and small, transit is losing market share to private vehicles. A host of factors no doubt influence transit ridership, including fares, routing, service frequency, stop/station accessibility, safety, private vehicle ownership levels, population density, land use, parking availability, and cost. But the relative importance of these factors and the ways they influence one another is less well understood. At the same time, the relationships between these factors and transit ridership are central to public policy debates about transportation system investments and the pricing and deployment of transit services. The research explaining transit ridership is surprisingly uneven, spanning a variety of methodological approaches, data sources, and variables that produce, perhaps not surprisingly, somewhat ambiguous, contradictory, and inconsistent results. Yet the factors affecting transit ridership are not simply matters of academic interest. Public investment in transit is waxing in response to the many problems of auto dependence, worsening traffic congestion, rising fuel prices, vehicle emissions, and so on. What can be done to increase patronage and better leverage these investments? To address this question, this paper reviews research on transit use, critiques the sometimes significant weaknesses in much of the previous work on this topic, draws conclusions from the more rigorous studies about which factors most influence transit use, and presents recommendations for future research.",https://openalex.org/W2010903698,openalex

Sleep may not be the only answer to the obesity pandemic, but its effect should be considered seriously, as even small changes in the energy balance are beneficial. Good sleep could be part of the obesity prevention approach.

We are currently facing a major obesity pandemic. Most alarming is the accelerated increase in overweight and obesity in children, with childhood obesity tracking into adulthood. Although there is a strong genetic contribution to obesity, the current pandemic has been driven by environmental factors. Unfortunately, interventions aiming to alter food selection (eg, less fat and sugar) and calorie intake (eg, smaller portions) and to increase physical activity have not been able to result in long-term weight loss and maintenance. These approaches are confounded by the fact that only an insignificant daily energy surplus could result in obesity over time. Although changes in the basic balance between energy intake (food calories) and expenditure (physical activity) are obviously responsible for the current obesity pandemic, our understanding of the factors that alter this balance remains incomplete. Intriguingly, sleep may be a factor that alters both sides of the energy balance equation. The precise physiological functions of sleep are unknown, but the contribution of sleep to physical and psychological health, and its social and economic significance, is increasingly recognised.1 Sleep research has mainly concentrated on the cognitive consequences of sleep loss, on the basis of the belief that sleep is for the brain alone. Recently, however, there has been a shift in interest in the consequences of sleep loss for other organs and several physiological systems. Also, more laboratory studies on sleep are now concentrating on investigating the health and performance effects of chronic partial sleep restriction, which is truer of real life, rather than acute total sleep deprivation.

This paper presents and tests a model in which urban vitality mediates the relationship between built environment characteristics and neighborhood social cohesion, using survey and geospatial data from the Oslo metropolitan area. We find that neighborhood density and land use mix are positive predictors of urban vitality, but are negatively associated with social cohesion. Green space is found to be associated with lower urban vitality, while public transport accessibility is associated with higher social cohesion. Results indicate seemingly contradictory relationships between the built environment, urban vitality and social cohesion. On the one hand, although compact urban form has higher levels of urban vitality, it has lower levels of social cohesion compared to low-density, single-use urban form. On the other hand, for similar urban form types, urban vitality is found to be positively associated with social cohesion, suggesting that local initiatives and interventions aiming to increase residents’ walking and social activity within their neighborhood could also strengthen social cohesion.",https://openalex.org/W3087432152,openalex

A considerable literature seeks to answer this question, yet concerns about reverse causality threaten the validity of extant conclusions. To estimate the impact of poverty on conflict and to determine whether the relationship between them is causal, it is necessary to identify a source of exogenous variation in poverty. We do this by introducing a robust instrument for poverty: a time-varying measure of international inequalities. We draw upon existing theories about the structural position of a country in the international economic network—specifically, the expectation that countries in the core tend to be wealthier and those on the periphery struggle to develop. This instrument is plausibly exogenous and satisfies the exclusion restriction, which suggests that it affects conflict only through its influence upon poverty. Instrumental variables probit regression is employed to demonstrate that the impact of poverty upon conflict appears to be causal.",https://openalex.org/W2049875132,openalex

Previous studies indicate an association between meteorological variables and dengue incidence using time series analyses. The impacts of meteorological changes can affect dengue outbreak. However, difficulties in collecting detailed time series data in developing countries have led to common use of monthly data in most previous studies. In addition, time series analyses are often limited to one area because of the difficulty in collecting meteorological and dengue incidence data in multiple areas. To gain better understanding, we examined the effects of meteorological factors on dengue incidence in three geographically distinct areas (Ratnapura, Colombo, and Anuradhapura) of Sri Lanka by time series analysis of weekly data. The weekly average maximum temperature and total rainfall and the total number of dengue cases from 2005 to 2011 (7 years) were used as time series data in this study. Subsequently, time series analyses were performed on the basis of ordinary least squares regression analysis followed by the vector autoregressive model (VAR).

Lawrence Venable,2005.0,,"Abstract Evolutionary ecologists have long sought to understand the conditions under which perennial (iteroparous) versus annual (semelparous) plant life histories are favored. We evaluated the idea that aridity and variation in the length of droughts should favor the evolution of an annual life history, both by decreasing adult survival and by increasing the potential for high seedling survival via reduced plant cover. We calculated phylogenetically independent contrasts of climate with respect to life history in a clade of winter-establishing evening primroses (sections Anogra and Kleinia; Oenothera; Onagraceae), which includes seven annuals, 12 perennials, and two variable taxa. Climate variables were quantified from long-term records at weather stations near collection localities. To explicitly account for phylogenetic uncertainty, contrasts were calculated on a random sample of phylogenetic trees from the posterior distribution of a Bayesian analysis of DNA sequence data. Statements of association are based on comparing the pertree mean contrast, which has a null expectation of zero, to a set of per-tree mean contrasts calculated on the same trees, after randomizing the climate data. As predicted, increased annual aridity, increased annual potential evapotranspiration, and decreased annual precipitation were associated with transitions to the annual habit, but these trends were not significantly different from the null pattern. Transitions to the annual habit were not significantly associated with increases in one measure of aridity in summer nor with increased summer drought, but they were associated with significantly increased maximum summer temperatures. In winter, increased aridity and decreased precipitation were significantly associated with transitions to the annual habit. Changes in life history were not significantly associated with changes in the coefficient of variation of precipitation, either on an annual or seasonal (summer vs. winter) basis. Though we cannot attribute causality on the basis of a correlational, historical study, our results are consistent with the idea that increased heat and drought at certain times of the year favor the evolution of the annual habit. Increased heat in summer may cause adult survival to decline, while increased aridity and decreased precipitation in the season of seedling recruitment (winter) may favor a drought-avoiding, short-lived annual strategy. Not all of the predicted patterns were observed: the capability for drought-induced dormancy may preclude change in habit in response to summer drought in our study group.",https://openalex.org/W2179817406,openalex

From interviews with 151 Scottish prisoners and non‐prisoners, divided into five drug‐using groups: (1) alcohol only; (2) cannabis and alcohol; (3) other drugs but not opioids; (4) moderate opioids; (5) heavy opioids, data were obtained on drug use frequency, crime frequency and a variety of other variables. It was found that: (1) there were no differences between incarcerated and non‐incarcerated opioid users, in fact incarceration had no substantial effects on other variables; (2) heavy opioid users committed crimes significantly more frequently than did moderate opioid users, non‐opioid poly drug users, cannabis users or alcohol users. But, moderate opioid users did not commit crimes significantly more frequently than did the other groups; (3) other drugs were related to crime. Polydrug use (including cannabis use) was more related to theft and delinquency than was opioid use. Alcohol use was related to fraud; (4) there were larger explanations of crime than opioid use—criminal experience and polydrug use—and crime was a better explanation of opioid use variance than opioid use was of crime. It is concluded that need for opioids did not simply cause crime. Rather, crime and opioid use tended to influence each other. However, this relationship was not special to opioids but, depending on historical circumstances, could—and to some extent does—apply to any drug. In consequence, society's treatment of drug‐using criminals needs to deal with drug use and crime together.",https://openalex.org/W2095223098,openalex

DeRouen; Theresa H.M. Keegan; Irene H. Yen; Mahasin S. Mujahid; William A. Satariano; Sally L. Glaser,2015.0,,"Neighborhood social and built environments have been recognized as important contexts in which health is shaped. The authors reviewed the extent to which these neighborhood factors have been addressed in population-level cancer research by scanning the literature for research focused on specific social and/or built environment characteristics and their association with outcomes across the cancer continuum, including incidence, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and survival. The commonalities and differences in methodologies across studies, the current challenges in research methodology, and future directions in this research also were addressed. The assessment of social and built environment factors in relation to cancer is a relatively new field, with 82% of the 34 reviewed articles published since 2010. Across the wide range of social and built environment exposures and cancer outcomes considered by the studies, numerous associations were reported. However, the directions and magnitudes of associations varied, in large part because of the variation in cancer sites and outcomes studied, but also likely because of differences in study populations, geographic regions, and, importantly, choice of neighborhood measures and geographic scales. The authors recommend that future studies consider the life-course implications of cancer incidence and survival, integrate secondary and self-report data, consider work neighborhood environments, and further develop analytical and statistical approaches appropriate to the geospatial and multilevel nature of the data. Incorporating social and built environment factors into research on cancer etiology and outcomes can provide insights into disease processes, identify vulnerable populations, and generate results with translational impact of relevance for interventionists and policy makers.",https://openalex.org/W1575144447,openalex
A1024,The Health Effects of Climate Change: A Survey of Recent Quantitative Research,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph9051523,Margherita Grasso; Matteo Manera; Aline Chiabai; Anil Markandya,2012.0,,"In recent years there has been a large scientific and public debate on climate change and its direct as well as indirect effects on human health. In particular, a large amount of research on the effects of climate changes on human health has addressed two fundamental questions. First, can historical data be of some help in revealing how short-run or long-run climate variations affect the occurrence of infectious diseases? Second, is it possible to build more accurate quantitative models which are capable of predicting the future effects of different climate conditions on the transmissibility of particularly dangerous infectious diseases? The primary goal of this paper is to review the most relevant contributions which have directly tackled those questions, both with respect to the effects of climate changes on the diffusion of non-infectious and infectious diseases, with malaria as a case study. Specific attention will be drawn on the methodological aspects of each study, which will be classified according to the type of quantitative model considered, namely time series models, panel data and spatial models, and non-statistical approaches. Since many different disciplines and approaches are involved, a broader view is necessary in order to provide a better understanding of the interactions between climate and health. In this respect, our paper also presents a critical summary of the recent literature related to more general aspects of the impacts of climate changes on human health, such as: the economics of climate change; how to manage the health effects of climate change; the establishment of Early Warning Systems for infectious diseases.",https://openalex.org/W1975386096,openalex
A1025,Poverty and Crime: Evidence from Rainfall and Trade Shocks in India,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2419522,Lakshmi Iyer; Petia Topalova,2014.0,,"Does poverty lead to crime? We shed light on this question using two independent and exogenous shocks to household income in rural India: the dramatic reduction in import tariffs in the early 1990s and rainfall variations. We find that trade shocks, previously shown to raise relative poverty, also increased the incidence of violent crimes and property crimes. The relationship between trade shocks and crime is similar to the observed relationship between rainfall shocks and crime. Our results thus identify a causal effect of poverty on crime. They also lend credence to a large literature on the effects of weather shocks on crime and conflict, which has usually assumed that the income channel is the most relevant one.",https://openalex.org/W1597246176,openalex

Hui,2020.0,,"Abstract Earth's tropical and subtropical rainbands, such as Intertropical Convergence Zones (ITCZs) and monsoons, are complex systems, governed by both large‐scale constraints on the atmospheric general circulation and regional interactions with continents and orography, and coupled to the ocean. Monsoons have historically been considered as regional large‐scale sea breeze circulations, driven by land‐sea contrast. More recently, a perspective has emerged of a global monsoon, a global‐scale solstitial mode that dominates the annual variation of tropical and subtropical precipitation. This results from the seasonal variation of the global tropical atmospheric overturning and migration of the associated convergence zone. Regional subsystems are embedded in this global monsoon, localized by surface boundary conditions. Parallel with this, much theoretical progress has been made on the fundamental dynamics of the seasonal Hadley cells and convergence zones via the use of hierarchical modeling approaches, including aquaplanets. Here we review the theoretical progress made and explore the extent to which these advances can help synthesize theory with observations to better understand differing characteristics of regional monsoons and their responses to certain forcings. After summarizing the dynamical and energetic balances that distinguish an ITCZ from a monsoon, we show that this theoretical framework provides strong support for the migrating convergence zone picture and allows constraints on the circulation to be identified via the momentum and energy budgets. Limitations of current theories are discussed, including the need for a better understanding of the influence of zonal asymmetries and transients on the large‐scale tropical circulation.",https://openalex.org/W3081331538,openalex
