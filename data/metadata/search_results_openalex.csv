This paper examines the factors behind the rapid increase in internationally traded food prices since 2002 and estimates the contribution of various factors such as the increased production of biofuels from food grains and oilseeds, the weak dollar, and the increase in food production costs due to higher energy prices. It concludes that the most important factor was the large increase in biofuels production in the U.S. and the EU. Without these increases, global wheat and maize stocks would not have declined appreciably, oilseed prices would not have tripled, and price increases due to other factors, such as droughts, would have been more moderate. Recent export bans and speculative activities would probably not have occurred because they were largely responses to rising prices. While it is difficult to compare the results of this study with those of other studies due to differences in methodologies, time periods and prices considered, many other studies have also recognized biofuels production as a major driver of food prices. The contribution of biofuels to the rise in food prices raises an important policy issue, since much of the increase was due to EU and U.S. government policies that provided incentives to biofuels production, and biofuels policies which subsidize production need to be reconsidered in light of their impact on food prices.

Corwyn,2002,,"▪ Abstract Socioeconomic status (SES) is one of the most widely studied constructs in the social sciences. Several ways of measuring SES have been proposed, but most include some quantification of family income, parental education, and occupational status. Research shows that SES is associated with a wide array of health, cognitive, and socioemotional outcomes in children, with effects beginning prior to birth and continuing into adulthood. A variety of mechanisms linking SES to child well-being have been proposed, with most involving differences in access to material and social resources or reactions to stress-inducing conditions by both the children themselves and their parents. For children, SES impacts well-being at multiple levels, including both family and neighborhood. Its effects are moderated by children's own characteristics, family characteristics, and external support systems.",https://openalex.org/W2171357886,https://openalex.org/W2171357886

Linking service climate and customer perceptions of service quality: Tests of a causal model.,https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.83.2.150,Benjamin Schneider; Susan S. White; Mathilde Paul,1998,,"A set of foundation issues that support employee work and service quality is conceptualized as a necessary but not sufficient cause of a climate for service, which in turn is proposed to be reflected in customer experiences. Climate for service rests on the foundation issues, but in addition it requires policies and practices that focus attention directly on service quality. Data were collected at multiple points in time from employees and customers of 134 branches of a bank and analyzed via structural equation modeling. Results indicated that the model in which the foundation issues yielded a climate for service, and climate for service in turn led to customer perceptions of service quality, fit the data well. However, subsequent cross-lagged analyses revealed the presence of a reciprocal effect for climate and customer perceptions.

This article argues that such conclusions may be premature because these studies, which usually test the conflict potential of `vertical inequality' (i.e. income inequality between individuals), tend to neglect the group aspect of inequality. Case studies suggest that what matters for conflict is a concept closely linked to both economic and ethnic polarization: `horizontal inequalities', or inequalities that coincide with identity-based cleavages. Horizontal inequalities may enhance both grievances and group cohesion among the relatively deprived and thus facilitate mobilization for conflict. This article provides a quantitative test of this argument, exploring whether various forms of polarization and horizontal inequalities affect the probability of civil conflict onset across 36 developing countries in the period 1986—2004. National household data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) are used to construct measures of ethnic, social and economic polarization, as well as vertical and horizontal inequalities along two dimensions: social and economic. The article also introduces a combined measure of ethnic/socio-economic polarization as an alternative to the horizontal inequality measure. Robust results from panel and cross-section analyses show that social polarization and horizontal social inequality are positively related to conflict outbreak. Variables for purely ethnic polarization, inter-individual inequalities and combined ethnic/socio-economic polarization are not significant.",https://openalex.org/W2116212710,https://openalex.org/W2116212710

Climate-driven declines in arthropod abundance restructure a rainforest food web,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1722477115,Bradford C. Lister; Andrés García,2018,,"A number of studies indicate that tropical arthropods should be particularly vulnerable to climate warming. If these predictions are realized, climate warming may have a more profound impact on the functioning and diversity of tropical forests than currently anticipated. Although arthropods comprise over two-thirds of terrestrial species, information on their abundance and extinction rates in tropical habitats is severely limited. Here we analyze data on arthropod and insectivore abundances taken between 1976 and 2012 at two midelevation habitats in Puerto Rico's Luquillo rainforest. During this time, mean maximum temperatures have risen by 2.0 °C. Using the same study area and methods employed by Lister in the 1970s, we discovered that the dry weight biomass of arthropods captured in sweep samples had declined 4 to 8 times, and 30 to 60 times in sticky traps. Analysis of long-term data on canopy arthropods and walking sticks taken as part of the Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research program revealed sustained declines in abundance over two decades, as well as negative regressions of abundance on mean maximum temperatures. We also document parallel decreases in Luquillo's insectivorous lizards, frogs, and birds. While El Niño/Southern Oscillation influences the abundance of forest arthropods, climate warming is the major driver of reductions in arthropod abundance, indirectly precipitating a bottom-up trophic cascade and consequent collapse of the forest food web.",https://openalex.org/W2896548525,https://openalex.org/W2896548525

However, these procedures provide little guidance for determining a priori whether constructs should be specified as causes or effects of their measures.

We find that the impact of global climate change on yields of different crops from climate trends ranged from -13.4% (oil palm) to 3.5% (soybean). Our results show that impacts are mostly negative in Europe, Southern Africa and Australia but generally positive in Latin America. Impacts in Asia and Northern and Central America are mixed.

McInnes; James S.

The impact of these events can be due to a single variable being in an extreme state, but more often it is the result of a combination of variables not all of which are necessarily extreme. Here, the combination of variables or events that lead to an extreme impact is referred to as a compound event. Any given compound event will depend upon the nature and number of physical variables, the range of spatial and temporal scales, the strength of dependence between processes, and the perspective of the stakeholder who defines the impact. Modeling compound events is a large, complex, and interdisciplinary undertaking. To facilitate this task we propose the use of influence diagrams for defining, mapping, analyzing, modeling, and communicating the risk of the compound event. Ultimately, a greater appreciation of compound events will lead to further insight and a changed perspective on how impact risks are associated with climate‐related hazards.

Shields,2008,,"The well-known Easterlin paradox points out that average happiness has remained constant over time despite sharp rises in GNP per head. At the same time, a micro literature has typically found positive correlations between individual income and individual measures of subjective well-being. This paper suggests that these two findings are consistent with the presence of relative income terms in the utility function. Income may be evaluated relative to others (social comparison) or to oneself in the past (habituation). We review the evidence on relative income from the subjective well-being literature. We also discuss the relation (or not) between happiness and utility, and discuss some nonhappiness research (behavioral, experimental, neurological) related to income comparisons.

The Social Stratification of Aging and Health,https://doi.org/10.2307/2137277,James S. House; James M. Lepkowski; Ann M. Kinney; Richard P. Mero; Ronald C. Kessler; A. Regula Herzog,1994,,"The way health varies with age is importantly stratified by socioeconomic status (SES)--specifically, education and income. Prior theory and cross-sectional data suggest that among higher SES persons the onset of health problems is usually postponed until rather late in life, while health declines are prevalent in lower SES groups by middle age. Thus, SES differences in health are small in early adulthood, but increase with age until relatively late in life, when they diminish due to selection or greater equalization of health risks and protections. The present paper strengthens our causal and interpretive understanding of these phenomena by showing: (1) that results previously reported for indices of SES hold separately for education and income; (2) that the interaction between age and SES (i.e., education or income) in predicting health can be substantially explained by the greater exposure of lower SES persons to a wide range of psychosocial risk factors to health, especially in middle and early old age, and, to a lesser degree, the greater impact of these risk factors on health with age; and (3) that results (1) and (2) generally hold in short-term longitudinal as well as in cross-sectional data.

Paralleling the COVID-19 pandemic crisis have been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis use disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. We examined the genetic relationship between CUD and COVID-19 hospitalization. We estimated the genetic correlation between CUD (case: n = 14,080; control: n = 343,726) and COVID-19 hospitalization (case: n = 9373; control: n = 1,197,256) using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. Using independent genome-wide association studies conducted before the pandemic, we controlled for several covariates (i.e., tobacco use phenotypes, problematic alcohol use, body mass index, fasting glucose, forced expiratory volume, education attainment, risk taking, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Townsend deprivation index, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes) using genomic structural equation modeling. Genetic causality between CUD and COVID-19 hospitalization was estimated using latent causal variable models. Genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 was correlated with genetic liability to CUD (rG = 0.423 [SE = 0.0965], p = 1.33 × 10−6); this association remained when accounting for genetic liability to related risk factors and covariates (b = 0.381–0.539, p = .012–.049). Latent causal variable analysis revealed causal effect estimates that were not statistically significant. Problematic cannabis use and vulnerability to serious COVID-19 complications share genetic underpinnings that are unique from common correlates. While CUD may plausibly contribute to severe COVID-19 presentations, causal inference models yielded no evidence of putative causation.

There is growing concern that flooding is becoming more frequent and severe in Europe. A better understanding of flood regime changes and their drivers is therefore needed. The paper reviews the current knowledge on flood regime changes in European rivers that has traditionally been obtained through two alternative research approaches. The first approach is the data-based detection of changes in observed flood events. Current methods are reviewed together with their challenges and opportunities. For example, observation biases, the merging of different data sources and accounting for nonlinear drivers and responses. The second approach consists of modelled scenarios of future floods. Challenges and opportunities associated with flood change scenarios are discussed such as fully accounting for uncertainties in the modelling cascade and feedbacks. To make progress in flood change research, we suggest that a synthesis of these two approaches is needed. This can be achieved by focusing on long duration records and flood-rich and flood-poor periods rather than on short duration flood trends only, by formally attributing causes of observed flood changes, by validating scenarios against observed flood regime dynamics, and by developing low-dimensional models of flood changes and feedbacks. The paper finishes with a call for a joint European flood change research network.",https://openalex.org/W2012408626,https://openalex.org/W2012408626

However, these intuitive distinctions can become blurred when comparing species distribution modelling approaches in more detail. In this review article, we contrast the extremes of the correlative–process spectrum of species distribution models with respect to core assumptions, model building and selection strategies, validation, uncertainties, common errors and the questions they are most suited to answer. The extremes of such approaches differ clearly in many aspects, such as model building approaches, parameter estimation strategies and transferability. However, they also share strengths and weaknesses. We show that claims of one approach being intrinsically superior to the other are misguided and that they ignore the process–correlation continuum as well as the domains of questions that each approach is addressing. Nonetheless, the application of process‐based approaches to species distribution modelling lags far behind more correlative (process‐implicit) methods and more research is required to explore their potential benefits. Critical issues for the employment of species distribution modelling approaches are given, together with a guideline for appropriate usage.

We first argue that social inquiry and its methods are productive: they (help to) make social realities and social worlds. They do not simply describe the world as it is, but also enact it. Second, we suggest that, if social investigation makes worlds, then it can, in some measure, think about the worlds it wants to help to make. It gets involved in ‘ontological politics’. We then go on to show that its methods - and its politics - are still stuck in, and tend to reproduce, nineteenth-century, nation-state-based politics. How might we move social science from the enactment of nineteenth-century realities? We argue that social-and-physical changes in the world are - and need to be - paralleled by changes in the methods of social inquiry. The social sciences need to re-imagine themselves, their methods, and their ‘worlds’ if they are to work productively in the twenty-first century where social relations appear increasingly complex, elusive, ephemeral, and unpredictable. There are various possibilities: perhaps, for instance, there is need for ‘messy’ methods. But in the present paper we explore some implications of complexity theory to see whether and how this might provide productive metaphors and theories for enacting twenty-first-century realities.",https://openalex.org/W2038420893,https://openalex.org/W2038420893
Plastic and evolutionary responses to climate change in fish,https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.12135,Lisa G. Crozier; Jeffrey A. Hutchings,2014,,"Abstract The physical and ecological ‘fingerprints’ of anthropogenic climate change over the past century are now well documented in many environments and taxa. We reviewed the evidence for phenotypic responses to recent climate change in fish. Changes in the timing of migration and reproduction, age at maturity, age at juvenile migration, growth, survival and fecundity were associated primarily with changes in temperature. Although these traits can evolve rapidly, only two studies attributed phenotypic changes formally to evolutionary mechanisms. The correlation‐based methods most frequently employed point largely to ‘fine‐grained’ population responses to environmental variability (i.e. rapid phenotypic changes relative to generation time), consistent with plastic mechanisms. Ultimately, many species will likely adapt to long‐term warming trends overlaid on natural climate oscillations.

Reducing the Future to Climate: A Story of Climate Determinism and Reductionism,https://doi.org/10.1086/661274,Mike Hulme,2011,,"AbstractThis article traces how climate has moved from playing a deterministic to a reductionist role in discourses about environment, society, and the future. Climate determinism previously offered an explanation, and hence a justification, for the superiority of certain imperial races and cultures. The argument put forward here is that the new climate reductionism is driven by the hegemony exercised by the predictive natural sciences over contingent, imaginative, and humanistic accounts of social life and visions of the future. It is a hegemony that lends disproportionate power in political and social discourse to model-based descriptions of putative future climates. Some possible reasons for this climate reductionism, as well as some of the limitations and dangers of this position for human relationships with the future, are suggested.",https://openalex.org/W1982404479,https://openalex.org/W1982404479

Racial Segregation and the American Foreclosure Crisis,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122410380868,Jacob S. Rugh; Douglas S. Massey,2010,,"Although the rise in subprime lending and the ensuing wave of foreclosures was partly a result of market forces that have been well-identified in the literature, in the United States it was also a highly racialized process. We argue that residential segregation created a unique niche of poor minority clients who were differentially marketed risky subprime loans that were in great demand for use in mortgage-backed securities that could be sold on secondary markets. We test this argument by regressing foreclosure actions in the top 100 U.S. metropolitan areas on measures of black, Hispanic, and Asian segregation while controlling for a variety of housing market conditions, including average creditworthiness, the extent of coverage under the Community Reinvestment Act, the degree of zoning regulation, and the overall rate of subprime lending. We find that black residential dissimilarity and spatial isolation are powerful predictors of foreclosures across U.S. metropolitan areas. In order to isolate subprime lending as the causal mechanism whereby segregation influences foreclosures, we estimate a two-stage least squares model that confirms the causal effect of black segregation on the number and rate of foreclosures across metropolitan areas. In the United States segregation was an important contributing cause of the foreclosure crisis, along with overbuilding, risky lending practices, lax regulation, and the bursting of the housing price bubble.",https://openalex.org/W2110446249,https://openalex.org/W2110446249
A Physics-Informed Auto-Learning Framework for Developing Stochastic Conceptual Models for ENSO Diversity,https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-24-0092.1,Yinling Zhang; Nan Chen; Jérôme Vialard; Xianghui Fang,2024,,"Abstract Understanding El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) dynamics has tremendously improved over the past few decades. The ENSO diversity in spatial pattern, peak intensity, and temporal evolution is, however, still poorly represented in conceptual ENSO models. In this paper, a physics-informed auto-learning framework is applied to derive ENSO stochastic conceptual models with varying degrees of freedom. The framework is computationally efficient and easy to apply. Once the state vector of the target model is set, causal inference is exploited to build the right-hand side of the equations based on a mathematical function library. Fundamentally different from standard nonlinear regression, the auto-learning framework provides a parsimonious model by retaining only terms that improve the dynamical consistency with observations. It can also identify crucial latent variables and provide physical explanations. This methodology successfully reconstructs the equations of a realistic six-dimensional reference ENSO model based on the recharge oscillator theory from its data. A hierarchy of lower-dimensional models is derived, and their representation of ENSO (including its diversity) is systematically assessed. The minimum model that represents ENSO diversity is four-dimensional, with three interannual variables describing the western Pacific thermocline depth, the eastern and central Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and one intraseasonal variable for westerly wind events. Without the intraseasonal variable, the resulting three-dimensional model underestimates extreme events and is too regular. A limited number of weak nonlinearities in the model are essential in reproducing the observed extreme El Niño events and the observed nonlinear relationship between eastern and western Pacific SSTs. Significance Statement This study develops a physics-informed auto-learning approach to improve the modeling and understanding of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a major climate phenomenon influencing global weather and climate. The auto-learning framework explores the causality between key processes to systematically produce stochastic conceptual models with different climate factors that simulate the diversity of observed ENSO events. The key finding is that the minimal model for characterizing the ENSO diversity (with the least number of climate factors) is a four-variable model capturing thermocline depth, sea surface temperatures, and wind bursts that can reproduce intensity and spatial pattern variation. This advancement provides an interpretable tool to identify the minimum sufficient processes governing ENSO behavior for improved predictability.",https://openalex.org/W4402775825,https://openalex.org/W4402775825

Social inequalities in health disentangling the underlying mechanisms.,,Noreen Goldman,2001,,"Differentials in health and longevity by socioeconomic status and by the nature of social relationships have been found in innumerable studies in the social and medical sciences. Three categories of explanations for the observed patterns have been proposed: causal mechanisms through which the social environment affects health status or the risk of dying; selection or reverse causal pathways whereby a person's health status affects their social position; and artifactual mechanisms, such as measurement error. The general consensus among researchers is that the observed disparities in health are driven largely by a complex set of causal processes rather than by selection or by artifactual mechanisms. This paper explores the set of arguments and strategies that researchers have used to arrive at this conclusion. As part of this undertaking, we assess whether inferences regarding the minor contribution of selection to the overall association between social factors and health are justifiable.

Our analysis has three focal points: the relative contributions of state dependence and heterogeneity in explaining the dynamics of health, the existence and consequences of health‐related sample attrition, and the investigation of the effects of measures of socioeconomic status, with a particular focus on educational attainment and income. To investigate these issues we use dynamic panel ordered probit models. There is clear evidence of health‐related attrition in the data but this does not distort the estimates of state dependence and of the socioeconomic gradient in health. The models show strong positive state dependence and heterogeneity accounts for around 30% of the unexplained variation in health.

We argue that the carbon balance approach is readily applicable for projecting forest yield and productivity, and review several carbon balance models for estimating stand productivity and individual tree growth and competition.

We present examples of hybrid carbon balance models and consider issues that currently require incorporation of empirical information at the system level. We review model calibration and validation methods that take account of the hybrid character of models. The operational implementation of process-based models to practical forest management is discussed. Methods of decision-making in forest management are gradually moving toward a more general, analytical approach, and it seems likely that models that include some process-oriented components will soon be used in forestry enterprises.

Five factors should account for changes in levels of concern: extreme weather events, public access to accurate scientific information, media coverage, elite cues, and movement/countermovement advocacy. Structural equation modeling indicates that elite cues, movement advocacy efforts, weather, and structural economic factors influence the level of public concern about climate change. While media coverage exerts an important influence, it is itself largely a function of elite cues and economic factors. Promulgation to the public of scientific information on climate change has no effect.

Gorman; Peter Daszak; Janet E. Foley,2008,,"Despite awareness that disease emergence may be related to ecological change, few studies have rigorously analyzed the underlying environmental drivers of the dynamics of disease emergence. This may be due to the fact that ecological change and disease emergence are often mediated through complex and large-scale processes that are not amenable to traditional reductionist approaches to causal inference. Here, we suggest strategies assembled from diverse disciplines, including ecology, epidemiology, and the social sciences, to analyze complex relationships, promote cooperation, increase efficiency, and minimize bias when investigating the ecological drivers of disease emergence. These techniques, which complement traditional hypothesis testing, include epidemiologic causal criteria, strong inference, causal diagrams, model selection, and triangulation. We also present several examples from recent emerging infectious disease investigations, including Hendra virus, Nipah virus, coral diseases, and avian influenza, where these techniques were successfully applied.

"On the relationship between personal experience, affect and risk perception:The case of climate change",https://doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.2008,Sander van der Linden,2014,,"Examining the conceptual relationship between personal experience, affect, and risk perception is crucial in improving our understanding of how emotional and cognitive process mechanisms shape public perceptions of climate change. This study is the first to investigate the interrelated nature of these variables by contrasting three prominent social-psychological theories. In the first model, affect is viewed as a fast and associative information processing heuristic that guides perceptions of risk. In the second model, affect is seen as flowing from cognitive appraisals (i.e., affect is thought of as a post-cognitive process). Lastly, a third, dual-process model is advanced that integrates aspects from both theoretical perspectives. Four structural equation models were tested on a national sample (N = 808) of British respondents. Results initially provide support for the ""cognitive"" model, where personal experience with extreme weather is best conceptualized as a predictor of climate change risk perception and, in turn, risk perception a predictor of affect. Yet, closer examination strongly indicates that at the same time, risk perception and affect reciprocally influence each other in a stable feedback system. It is therefore concluded that both theoretical claims are valid and that a dual-process perspective provides a superior fit to the data. Implications for theory and risk communication are discussed. © 2014 The Authors.

Menegaki,2019,,"This paper examines the causal relationships between economic growth, energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in high-income and upper-middle-income countries using the simultaneous equations framework, with data from 1985 to 2011. By taking institutional quality (measured by the level of corruption) and climate (measured by average temperatures over the winter and summer months) into account, this is the first study to incorporate both of these factors into a simultaneous equations model within the energy-environment-growth nexus. The dependent variables in the system of three simultaneous equations are real gross domestic product (GDP), energy consumption and CO2 emissions as a proxy for air pollution. The results have two important implications. First, they document a bidirectional causal relationship between GDP and energy consumption but do not provide support for the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. This is revolutionary in the sense that it indicates that high-income and upper-middle-income countries base their economic growth on a feedback relationship with energy consumption and that the ensuing pollution has not yet reached a maximum point, even in these countries. Second, by implying that climate and weather variations are more important determinants of energy consumption and CO2 emissions than corruption, the results suggest that changes in institutional quality are likely to have only a limited impact on energy and environmental policies.",https://openalex.org/W2918145827,https://openalex.org/W2918145827

Needs and subjective well-being around the world.,https://doi.org/10.1037/a0023779,Louis Tay; Ed Diener,2011,,"Across a sample of 123 countries, we examined the association between the fulfillment of needs and subjective well-being (SWB), including life evaluation, positive feelings, and negative feelings. Need fulfillment was consistently associated with SWB across world regions. Life evaluation was most associated with fulfilling basic needs; positive feelings were most associated with social and respect needs; and negative feelings were most associated with basic, respect, and autonomy needs. Societal need fulfillment predicted SWB, particularly for life evaluation, beyond individuals' fulfillment of their own needs, indicating the desirability of living in a flourishing society. In addition, the associations of SWB with the fulfillment of specific needs were largely independent of whether other needs were fulfilled. These trends persisted when household income was taken into account. The emergent ordering of need fulfillment for psychosocial needs were fairly consistent across country conditions, but the fulfillment of basic and safety needs were contingent on country membership.",https://openalex.org/W2099772303,https://openalex.org/W2099772303

These concepts are becoming ever more central to the resilience debate. They aggregate elements of climate change adaptation, critical infrastructure protection, and societal resilience in the face of complex, high‐impact events. However, despite the potential of these concepts to link together diverse disciplines, scholars and practitioners need to avoid treating them in a superficial or ambiguous manner. Overlapping uses and definitions could generate confusion and lead to the duplication of research effort. This article gives an overview of the state of the art regarding compound, interconnected, interacting, and cascading risks. It is intended to help build a coherent basis for the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR). The main objective is to propose a holistic framework that highlights the complementarities of the four kinds of complex risk in a manner that is designed to support the work of researchers and policymakers. This article suggests how compound, interconnected, interacting, and cascading risks could be used, with little or no redundancy, as inputs to new analyses and decisional tools designed to support the implementation of the SFDRR. The findings can be used to improve policy recommendations and support tools for emergency and crisis management, such as scenario building and impact trees, thus contributing to the achievement of a system‐wide approach to resilience.",https://openalex.org/W2808626396,https://openalex.org/W2808626396

Here, we detail the mechanisms by which climate drivers can shape infectious disease incidence, from direct effects on vector life history to indirect effects on human susceptibility, and detail the scope of variation available with which to probe these mechanisms. We review approaches used to evaluate and quantify associations between climate and infectious disease incidence, discuss the array of data available to tackle this question, and detail remaining challenges in understanding the implications of climate change for infectious disease incidence.

Hernandez; Sanjay Basu; George Sugihara,2016,,"In temperate countries, influenza outbreaks are well correlated to seasonal changes in temperature and absolute humidity. However, tropical countries have much weaker annual climate cycles, and outbreaks show less seasonality and are more difficult to explain with environmental correlations. Here, we use convergent cross mapping, a robust test for causality that does not require correlation, to test alternative hypotheses about the global environmental drivers of influenza outbreaks from country-level epidemic time series. By moving beyond correlation, we show that despite the apparent differences in outbreak patterns between temperate and tropical countries, absolute humidity and, to a lesser extent, temperature drive influenza outbreaks globally. We also find a hypothesized U-shaped relationship between absolute humidity and influenza that is predicted by theory and experiment, but hitherto has not been documented at the population level. The balance between positive and negative effects of absolute humidity appears to be mediated by temperature, and the analysis reveals a key threshold around 75 °F.

In this target article, we present a meta-analytic summary of the neuroimaging literature on human emotion. We compare the locationist approach (i.e., the hypothesis that discrete emotion categories consistently and specifically correspond to distinct brain regions) with the psychological constructionist approach (i.e., the hypothesis that discrete emotion categories are constructed of more general brain networks not specific to those categories) to better understand the brain basis of emotion. We review both locationist and psychological constructionist hypotheses of brain-emotion correspondence and report meta-analytic findings bearing on these hypotheses. Overall, we found little evidence that discrete emotion categories can be consistently and specifically localized to distinct brain regions. Instead, we found evidence that is consistent with a psychological constructionist approach to the mind: A set of interacting brain regions commonly involved in basic psychological operations of both an emotional and non-emotional nature are active during emotion experience and perception across a range of discrete emotion categories.",https://openalex.org/W2105931454,https://openalex.org/W2105931454
The economic cost of air pollution: Evidence from Europe,https://doi.org/10.1787/56119490-en,Antoine Dechezleprêtre; Nicholas Rivers; Balazs Stadler,2019,,"This study provides the first evidence that air pollution causes economy-wide reductions in market economic activity based on data for Europe. The analysis combines satellite-based measures of air pollution with statistics on regional economic activity at the NUTS-3 level throughout the European Union over the period 2000-15. An instrumental variables approach based on thermal inversions is used to identify the causal impact of air pollution on economic activity. The estimates show that a 1μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration (or a 10% increase at the sample mean) causes a 0.8% reduction in real GDP that same year. Ninety-five per cent of this impact is due to reductions in output per worker, which can occur through greater absenteeism at work or reduced labour productivity. Therefore, the results suggest that public policies to reduce air pollution may contribute positively to economic growth. Indeed, the large economic benefits from pollution reduction uncovered in the study compare with relatively small abatement costs. Thus, more stringent air quality regulations could be warranted based solely on economic grounds, even ignoring the large benefits in terms of avoided mortality.",https://openalex.org/W2996395020,https://openalex.org/W2996395020

The wavelet transform (WT) has been successfully applied over an extraordinary range of fields in order to decompose the non-stationary TS into time-frequency domain. For this reason, the WT method is briefly introduced and reviewed in this paper. In addition, this latter includes different research and applications of the WT to non-stationary TS in seven different applied sciences fields, namely the geo-sciences and geophysics, remote sensing in vegetation analysis, engineering, hydrology, finance, medicine, and other fields, such as ecology, renewable energy, chemistry and history.

In spite of a growing level of interest and progress in determining climate change effects on infectious disease, the debate on the potential health outcomes remains polarizing, which is partly attributable to the varying effects of climate change, different types of pathogen-host systems, and spatio-temporal scales. We summarize the published evidence and show that over the past few decades, the reported negative or uncertain responses of infectious diseases to climate change has been growing. A feature of the research tendency is the focus on temperature and insect-borne diseases at the local and decadal scale. Geographically, regions experiencing higher temperature anomalies have been given more research attention; unfortunately, the Earth's most vulnerable regions to climate variability and extreme events have been less studied. From local to global scales, agreements on the response of infectious diseases to climate change tend to converge. So far, an abundance of findings have been based on statistical methods, with the number of mechanistic studies slowly growing.

Antarctic Sea Ice Extent Variability and Its Global Connectivity*,https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(2000)013<1697:asieva>2.0.co;2,Xiaojun Yuan; Douglas G. Martinson,2000,,"This study statistically evaluates the relationship between Antarctic sea ice extent and global climate variability. Temporal cross correlations between detrended Antarctic sea ice edge (SIE) anomaly and various climate indices are calculated. For the sea surface temperature (SST) in the eastern equatorial Pacific and tropical Indian Ocean, as well as the tropical Pacific precipitation, a coherent propagating pattern is clearly evident in all correlations with the spatially averaged (over 12° longitude) detrended SIE anomalies (〈SIE*〉). Correlations with ENSO indices imply that up to 34% of the variance in 〈SIE*〉 is linearly related to ENSO. The 〈SIE*〉 has even higher correlations with the tropical Pacific precipitation and SST in the tropical Indian Ocean. In addition, correlation of 〈SIE*〉 with global surface temperature produces four characteristic correlation patterns: 1) an ENSO-like pattern in the Tropics with strong correlations in the Indian Ocean and North America (r > 0.6); 2) a teleconnection pattern between the eastern Pacific region of the Antarctic and western–central tropical Pacific; 3) an Antarctic dipole across the Drake Passage; and 4) meridional banding structures in the central Pacific and Atlantic expending from polar regions to the Tropics, even to the Northern Hemisphere. The SIE anomalies in the Amundsen Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, and Weddell Gyre of the Antarctic polar ocean sectors show the strongest polar links to extrapolar climate. Linear correlations between 〈SIE*〉 in those regions and global climate parameters pass a local significance test at the 95% confidence level. The field significance, designed to account for spatial coherence in the surface temperature, is evaluated using quasiperiodic colored noise that is more appropriate than white noise. The fraction of the globe displaying locally significant correlations (at the 95% confidence level) between 〈SIE*〉 and global temperature is significantly larger, at the 99.5% confidence level, than the fraction expected given quasiperiodic colored noise in place of the 〈SIE*〉. Based on EOF analysis and multiplicity theory, the four teleconnection patterns the authors found are the ones reflecting correlations most likely to be physically meaningful.",https://openalex.org/W2175519760,https://openalex.org/W2175519760
The Atmospheric Response to Three Decades of Observed Arctic Sea Ice Loss,https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-12-00063.1,James A. Screen; Ian Simmonds; Clara Deser; Robert A. Tomas,2012,,"Abstract Arctic sea ice is declining at an increasing rate with potentially important repercussions. To understand better the atmospheric changes that may have occurred in response to Arctic sea ice loss, this study presents results from atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiments in which the only time-varying forcings prescribed were observed variations in Arctic sea ice and accompanying changes in Arctic sea surface temperatures from 1979 to 2009. Two independent AGCMs are utilized in order to assess the robustness of the response across different models. The results suggest that the atmospheric impacts of Arctic sea ice loss have been manifested most strongly within the maritime and coastal Arctic and in the lowermost atmosphere. Sea ice loss has driven increased energy transfer from the ocean to the atmosphere, enhanced warming and moistening of the lower troposphere, decreased the strength of the surface temperature inversion, and increased lower-tropospheric thickness; all of these changes are most pronounced in autumn and early winter (September–December). The early winter (November–December) atmospheric circulation response resembles the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO); however, the NAO-type response is quite weak and is often masked by intrinsic (unforced) atmospheric variability. Some evidence of a late winter (March–April) polar stratospheric cooling response to sea ice loss is also found, which may have important implications for polar stratospheric ozone concentrations. The attribution and quantification of other aspects of the possible atmospheric response are hindered by model sensitivities and large intrinsic variability. The potential remote responses to Arctic sea ice change are currently hard to confirm and remain uncertain.",https://openalex.org/W2074383937,https://openalex.org/W2074383937

The results provide strong evidence that women who spend part of their childhoods in one-parent families are more likely to marry and bear children early, give birth before marriage, and have their own marriages break up. The major exception is that, among blacks, early marriage is unrelated to family background. Several explanations for intergenerational consequences are tested, including the economic-deprivation hypothesis, the socialization hypothesis, and the stress hypothesis.

Does Renewable Energy Drive Sustainable Economic Growth? Multivariate Panel Data Evidence for EU-28 Countries,https://doi.org/10.3390/en10030381,Daniel Armeanu; Georgeta Vintilă; Ștefan Cristian Gherghina,2017,,"Energy is crucial to economic progress, but the contemporary worldwide population increase that demands greater energy generated from conventional exhaustible resources, an energy price upsurge, and environmental concerns, imperils sustainable economic growth. Nevertheless, switching to renewable energy produced from naturally replenished resources promotes energy security, likewise addressing issues such as global warming and climate change. This paper aims at exploring the influence and causal relation between renewable energy, both overall and by type, and sustainable economic growth of European Union (EU)-28 countries for the period of 2003–2014. We notice that the mean share of renewable energy in the gross final energy consumption is 15%, while the mean share of renewable energy in transport fuel consumption is 3%, which are below the thresholds of 20% and 10%, respectively, as set by the EU Directive 2009/28/EC. By estimating panel data fixed-effects regression models, the results provide support for a positive influence of renewable energy overall, as well as by type, namely biomass, hydropower, geothermal energy, wind power, and solar energy on gross domestic product per capita. However, biomass energy shows the highest influence on economic growth among the rest of renewable energy types. In fact, a 1% increase of the primary production of solid biofuels increases GDP per capita by 0.16%. Besides, cointegrating regressions set on panel fully modified and dynamic ordinary least squares regressions confirm the positive influence related to the primary production of renewable energies on economic growth. A 1% increase in primary production of renewable energies increases GDP per capita by 0.05%–0.06%. However, the results of Granger causality based on panel vector error correction model indicate both in short-run and long-run a unidirectional causal relationship running from sustainable economic growth to the primary production of renewable energies, being supported the conservation hypothesis.",https://openalex.org/W2596293608,https://openalex.org/W2596293608

However, due to the recency of the COVID-19 problem, the impacts of macroeconomic fluctuations on food insecurity have remained scantily explored. In this study, the authors attempted to bridge this gap by revealing interactions between the food security status of people and the dynamics of COVID-19 cases, food trade, food inflation, and currency volatilities. The study was performed in the cases of 45 developing economies distributed to three groups by the level of income. The consecutive application of the autoregressive distributed lag method, Yamamoto’s causality test, and variance decomposition analysis allowed the authors to find the food insecurity effects of COVID-19 to be more perceptible in upper-middle-income economies than in the least developed countries. In the latter, food security risks attributed to the emergence of the health crisis were mainly related to economic access to adequate food supply (food inflation), whereas in higher-income developing economies, availability-sided food security risks (food trade restrictions and currency depreciation) were more prevalent. The approach presented in this paper contributes to the establishment of a methodology framework that may equip decision-makers with up-to-date estimations of health crisis effects on economic parameters of food availability and access to staples in food-insecure communities.",https://openalex.org/W3048185517,https://openalex.org/W3048185517

Do concerns about climate change lead to distress?,https://doi.org/10.1108/17568691011089891,Kristina Searle; Kathryn Gow,2010,,"Purpose Climate change news and educational awareness programs have swamped Australia in the past four years, with earlier campaigns raising awareness in Europe and the USA via television and the internet. What is the impact on people's psychological states of such concerns? The purpose of this paper is to explore the psychological impact of climate change within the general population and investigate what makes an individual vulnerable to distress. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire was completed by 275 adults that assessed personality factors as well as environmental beliefs and religiosity. The design was cross‐sectional, and correlational analyses determined the associations between climate change distress and symptoms indicative of depression, anxiety and stress. Independent samples t ‐tests and ANOVA revealed group differences for age and gender. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to identify important, unique predictors and to determine the extent to which environmental beliefs, future anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty and religiosity accounted for the variability in climate change measures beyond the effects of age and gender. Findings This study indicates that the public is becoming increasingly concerned about climate change and that there is a relationship between this concern and symptoms that are indicative of depression, anxiety and stress. The results indicate that an individual is more likely to be distressed about climate change if they are female, under the age of 35 years, have a pro‐environmental orientation, and possess personality traits such as high levels of future anxiety. Originality/value Bringing attention to the existence of climate change distress, understanding the extent of these fears and what makes a person vulnerable will be helpful in the treatment and prevention of general and clinical levels of climate‐related distress.",https://openalex.org/W1975022459,https://openalex.org/W1975022459

Does the Environment Still Matter? Daily Temperature and Income in the United States,https://doi.org/10.3386/w20750,Tatyana Deryugina; Solomon Hsiang,2014,,"It is widely hypothesized that incomes in wealthy countries are insulated from environmental conditions because individuals have the resources needed to adapt to their environment.We test this idea in the wealthiest economy in human history.Using within-county variation in weather, we estimate the effect of daily temperature on annual income in United States counties over a 40-year period.We find that this single environmental parameter continues to play a large role in overall economic performance: productivity of individual days declines roughly 1.7% for each 1°C (1.8°F) increase in daily average temperature above 15°C (59°F).A weekday above 30°C (86°F) costs an average county $20 per person.Hot weekends have little effect.These estimates are net of many forms of adaptation, such as factor reallocation, defensive investments, transfers, and price changes.Because the effect of temperature has not changed since 1969, we infer that recent uptake or innovation in adaptation measures have been limited.The non-linearity of the effect on different components of income suggest that temperature matters because it reduces the productivity of the economy's basic elements, such as workers and crops.If counties could choose daily temperatures to maximize output, rather than accepting their geographicallydetermined endowment, we estimate that annual income growth would rise by 1.7 percentage points.Applying our estimates to a distribution of ""business as usual"" climate change projections indicates that warmer daily temperatures will lower annual growth by 0.06-0.16percentage points in the United States unless populations engage in new forms of adaptation.",https://openalex.org/W1544628749,https://openalex.org/W1544628749

As a whole, the recent literature provides a more complete and nuanced picture of the retrospective voter as sometimes, but not always, effectively incentivizing elected officials to enhance public welfare. Leveraging examples of retrospective voting in areas other than the economy, the field is heading toward a middle ground in which voters resemble decision makers in many other domains. In many cases, a coherent logic governs voters' choices. In other instances, voters make mistakes, often in predictable ways subject to well-known psychological biases. Understanding the circumstances under which retrospective voting achieves effective democratic accountability and when it fails to do so is an important task for subsequent research.

Reproductive limits of a late‐flowering high‐mountain Mediterranean plant along an elevational climate gradient,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2006.01932.x,Luis Giménez‐Benavides; Adrián Escudero; José María Iriondo,2006,,"Summary Mountain plants are particularly sensitive to climate warming because snowmelt timing exerts a direct control on their reproduction. Current warming is leading to earlier snowmelt dates and longer snow‐free periods. Our hypothesis is that high‐mountain Mediterranean plants are not able to take advantage of a lengthened snow‐free period because this leads to longer drought that truncates the growing season. However, reproductive timing may somewhat mitigate these negative effects through temporal shifts. We assessed the effects of flowering phenology on the reproductive success of Silene ciliata , a Mediterranean high‐mountain plant, across an altitudinal gradient during two climatically contrasting years. The species showed a late‐flowering pattern hampering the use of snowmelt water. Plant fitness was largely explained by the elapsed time from snowmelt to onset of flowering, suggesting a selective pressure towards early flowering caused by soil moisture depletion. The proportion of flowering plants decreased at the lowest population, especially in the drier year. Plants produced more flowers, fruits and seeds at the highest population and in the mild year. Our results indicate that water deficit in dry years could threaten the lowland populations of this mountainous species, while high‐altitude environments are more stable over time.",https://openalex.org/W2013559021,https://openalex.org/W2013559021

This review of market events and their economic interpretations finds that recent price spikes are not as unusual as many discussions imply. Further, the balance between consumption, available supply, and stocks seems to be as relevant for our understanding of these markets as it was decades ago.

Relation between interannual variations in satellite measures of northern forest greenness and climate between 1982 and 1999,https://doi.org/10.1029/2002jd002510,Liming Zhou; Robert K. Kaufmann; Yuhong Tian; Ranga B. Myneni; Compton J. Tucker,2003,,"This paper analyzes the relation between satellite‐based measures of vegetation greenness and climate by land cover type at a regional scale (2° × 2° grid boxes) between 1982 and 1999. We use the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies (GIMMS) data set to quantify climate‐induced changes in terrestrial vegetation. Climatic conditions are represented with monthly data for land surface air temperature and precipitation. The relation between NDVI and the climate variables is represented using a quadratic specification, which is consistent with the notion of a physiological optimum. The effects of spatial heterogeneity and unobserved variables are estimated with specifications and statistical techniques that allow coefficients to vary among grid boxes. Using this methodology, we are able to estimate statistically meaningful relations between NDVI and climate during spring, summer, and autumn for forests between 40°N and 70°N in North America and Eurasia. Of the variables examined, changes in temperature account for the largest fraction of the change in NDVI between the early 1980s and the late 1990s. Changes in stratospheric aerosol optical depth and precipitation have a smaller effect, while artifacts associated with variations in solar zenith angle are negligible. These results indicate that temperature changes between the early 1980s and the late 1990s are responsible for much of the observed increase in satellite measures of northern forest greenness.",https://openalex.org/W1994936507,https://openalex.org/W1994936507

This study examined whether a similar association could be found in the southern United States, with different weather patterns than the previous studies, and examined the sensitivity of the results to different methods of analysis and covariate control. Data were available in Birmingham, Alabama, from August 1985 through 1988. Regression analyses controlled for weather, time trends, day of the week, and year of study and removed any long-term patterns (such as seasonal and monthly fluctuations) from the data by trigonometric filtering. A significant association was found between inhalable particles and daily mortality in Poisson regression analysis (relative risk = 1.11, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.20). The relative risk was estimated for a 100-micrograms/m3 increase in inhalable particles. Results were unchanged when least squares regression was used, when robust regression was used, and under an alternative filtering scheme. Diagnostic plots showed that the filtering successfully removed long wavelength patterns from the data. The generalized additive model, which models the expected number of deaths as nonparametric smoothed functions of the covariates, was then used to ensure adequate control for any nonlinearities in the weather dependence. Essentially identical results for inhalable particles were seen, with no evidence of a threshold down to the lowest observed exposure levels. The association also was unchanged when all days with particulate air pollution levels in excess of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards were deleted. The magnitude of the effect is consistent with recent estimates from Philadelphia, Steubenville, Detroit, Minneapolis, St. Louis, and Utah Valley.",https://openalex.org/W1909880584,https://openalex.org/W1909880584

Based on a recently rigorized physical notion, namely, information flow, we solve an inverse problem and give this important and challenging question, which is of interest in a wide variety of disciplines, a positive answer. Here causality is measured by the time rate of information flowing from one series to the other. The resulting formula is tight in form, involving only commonly used statistics, namely, sample covariances; an immediate corollary is that causation implies correlation, but correlation does not imply causation. It has been validated with touchstone linear and nonlinear series, purportedly generated with one-way causality that evades the traditional approaches. It has also been applied successfully to the investigation of real-world problems; an example presented here is the cause-and-effect relation between the two climate modes, El Niño and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), which have been linked to hazards in far-flung regions of the globe. In general, the two modes are mutually causal, but the causality is asymmetric: El Niño tends to stabilize IOD, while IOD functions to make El Niño more uncertain. To El Niño, the information flowing from IOD manifests itself as a propagation of uncertainty from the Indian Ocean.",https://openalex.org/W2312414574,https://openalex.org/W2312414574

It is predicted that such climate change will increase the severity and frequency of climate-related disasters like flash floods, surges, cyclones, and severe storms. This article uses econometric methods to study the consequences of climate-induced natural disasters on economic growth, and how these disasters are linked to the onset of armed civil conflict either directly or via their impact on economic growth. The results show that climate-related natural disasters have a negative effect on growth and that the impact is considerable. The analysis of conflict onset shows that climate-related natural disasters do not increase the risk of armed conflict. This is also true when we instrument the change in GDP growth by climatic disasters. The result is robust to inclusion of country and time fixed effects, different estimation techniques, and various operationalization of the disasters measure, as well as for conflict incidence and war onset. These findings have two major implications: if climate change increases the frequency or makes weather-related natural disasters more severe, it is an economic concern for countries susceptible to these types of hazards. However, our results suggest – based on historical data – that more frequent and severe climate-related disasters will not lead to more armed conflicts through their effects on GDP growth.",https://openalex.org/W2119227836,https://openalex.org/W2119227836

Granger Causality of Coupled Climate Processes: Ocean Feedback on the North Atlantic Oscillation,https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli3653.1,Timothy J. Mosedale; David B. Stephenson; Matthew Collins; Terence C. Mills,2006,,"Abstract This study uses a Granger causality time series modeling approach to quantitatively diagnose the feedback of daily sea surface temperatures (SSTs) on daily values of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) as simulated by a realistic coupled general circulation model (GCM). Bivariate vector autoregressive time series models are carefully fitted to daily wintertime SST and NAO time series produced by a 50-yr simulation of the Third Hadley Centre Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere GCM (HadCM3). The approach demonstrates that there is a small yet statistically significant feedback of SSTs on the NAO. The SST tripole index is found to provide additional predictive information for the NAO than that available by using only past values of NAO—the SST tripole is Granger causal for the NAO. Careful examination of local SSTs reveals that much of this effect is due to the effect of SSTs in the region of the Gulf Steam, especially south of Cape Hatteras. The effect of SSTs on NAO is responsible for the slower-than-exponential decay in lag-autocorrelations of NAO notable at lags longer than 10 days. The persistence induced in daily NAO by SSTs causes long-term means of NAO to have more variance than expected from averaging NAO noise if there is no feedback of the ocean on the atmosphere. There are greater long-term trends in NAO than can be expected from aggregating just short-term atmospheric noise, and NAO is potentially predictable provided that future SSTs are known. For example, there is about 10%–30% more variance in seasonal wintertime means of NAO and almost 70% more variance in annual means of NAO due to SST effects than one would expect if NAO were a purely atmospheric process.",https://openalex.org/W1975049191,https://openalex.org/W1975049191
A theory of migration: the aspirations-capabilities framework,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-020-00210-4,Hein de Haas,2021,,"This paper elaborates an aspirations-capabilities framework to advance our understanding of human mobility as an intrinsic part of broader processes of social change. In order to achieve a more meaningful understanding of agency and structure in migration processes, this framework conceptualises migration as a function of aspirations and capabilities to migrate within given sets of perceived geographical opportunity structures. It distinguishes between the instrumental (means-to-an-end) and intrinsic (directly wellbeing-affecting) dimensions of human mobility. This yields a vision in which moving and staying are seen as complementary manifestations of migratory agency and in which human mobility is defined as people's capability to choose where to live, including the option to stay, rather than as the act of moving or migrating itself. Drawing on Berlin's concepts of positive and negative liberty (as manifestations of the widely varying structural conditions under which migration occurs) this paper conceptualises how macro-structural change shapes people's migratory aspirations and capabilities. The resulting framework helps to understand the complex and often counter-intuitive ways in which processes of social transformation and 'development' shape patterns of migration and enable us to integrate the analysis of almost all forms of migratory mobility within one meta-conceptual framework.",https://openalex.org/W3134083113,https://openalex.org/W3134083113

The absolute radiometers carried by satellites since the late 1970s have produced indisputable evidence that total solar irradiance varies systematically over the 11-year sunspot cycle, relegating to history the term ""solar constant"", but it is difficult to explain how the apparent response to the Sun, seen in many climate records, can be brought about by these rather small changes in radiation.

In 2015 the United Nations (UN) established the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development with the aim of eradicating extreme poverty, reducing inequality and protecting the planet. The Agenda 2030 highlights the importance of biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems to maintain economic activities and the well-being of local communities. Nature Based Solutions (NBS) support biodiversity conservation and the functioning of ecosystems. NBS are increasingly seen as innovative solutions to manage water-related risks while transforming natural capital into a source of green growth and sustainable development. In this context, NBS could potentially contribute to the achievement of several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by promoting the delivery of bundles of ecosystem services together generating various social, economic and environmental co-benefits. However, to achieve the full potential of NBS, it is necessary to recognize the trade-offs and synergies of the co-benefits associated with their implementation. To this aim, we have adopted a system perspective and a multi-sectoral approach to analyse the potential of NBS to deliver co-benefits while at the same time reducing the negative effects of water-related hazards. Using the case study of Copenhagen, we have analysed the relationships between the co-benefits associated with the scenario of the restoration of the Ladegaardsaa urban river. Our hypothesis is that enhancing the understanding of the social, economic and environmental factors of the system, including mutual influences and trade-offs, could improve the decision-making process and thereby enhance the capability of NBS to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs.",https://openalex.org/W3033083323,https://openalex.org/W3033083323

Frongillo; Ronette Briefel,2001,,"OBJECTIVES: This study investigated associations between family income, food insufficiency, and health among US preschool and school-aged children. METHODS: Data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed. Children were classified as food insufficient if the family respondent reported that the family sometimes or often did not get enough food to eat. Regression analyses were conducted with health measures as the outcome variables. Prevalence rates of health variables were compared by family income category, with control for age and gender. Odds ratios for food insufficiency were calculated with control for family income and other potential confounding factors. RESULTS: Low-income children had a higher prevalence of poor/fair health status and iron deficiency than high-income children. After confounding factors, including poverty status, had been controlled, food-insufficient children were significantly more likely to have poorer health status and to experience more frequent stomachaches and headaches than food-sufficient children; preschool food-insufficient children had more frequent colds. CONCLUSIONS: Food insufficiency and low family income are health concerns for US preschool and school-aged children.",https://openalex.org/W1597284883,https://openalex.org/W1597284883
The Impact of Climate Variability and Change on Food Security in Sub-Saharan Africa: Perspective from Panel Data Analysis,https://doi.org/10.3390/su14020759,Raïfatou Affoh; Haixia Zheng; Kokou Dangui; Badoubatoba Mathieu Dissani,2022,,"This study investigates the relationship between climate variables such as rainfall amount, temperature, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission and the triple dimension of food security (availability, accessibility, and utilization) in a panel of 25 sub-Saharan African countries from 1985 to 2018. After testing for cross-sectional dependence, unit root and cointegration, the study estimated the pool mean group (PMG) panel autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL). The empirical outcome revealed that rainfall had a significantly positive effect on food availability, accessibility, and utilization in the long run. In contrast, temperature was harmful to food availability and accessibility and had no impact on food utilization. Lastly, CO2 emission positively impacted food availability and accessibility but did not affect food utilization. The study took a step further by integrating some additional variables and performed the panel fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) regression to ensure the robustness of the preceding PMG results. The control variables yielded meaningful results in most cases, so did the FMOLS and DOLS regression. The Granger causality test was conducted to determine the causal link, if any, among the variables. There was evidence of a short-run causal relationship between food availability and CO2 emission. Food accessibility exhibited a causal association with temperature, whereas food utilization was strongly connected with temperature. CO2 emission was linked to rainfall. Lastly, a bidirectional causal link was found between rainfall and temperature. Recommendations to the national, sub-regional, and regional policymakers are addressed and discussed.",https://openalex.org/W4206148239,https://openalex.org/W4206148239
Estimating the mortality impacts of particulate matter: what can be learned from between-study variability?,https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.00108109,Jonathan I. Levy; James K. Hammitt; J D Spengler,2000,,"Epidemiologic studies of the link between particulate matter (PM) concentrations and mortality rates have yielded a range of estimates, leading to disagreement about the magnitude of the relationship and the strength of the causal connection. Previous meta-analyses of this literature have provided pooled effect estimates, but have not addressed between-study variability that may be associated with analytical models, pollution patterns, and exposed populations. To determine whether study-specific factors can explain some of the variability in the time-series studies on mortality from particulate matter [less than/equal to] 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(10)), we applied an empirical Bayes meta-analysis. We estimate that mortality rates increase on average by 0.7% per 10 microg/m(3) increase in PM(10) concentrations, with greater effects at sites with higher ratios of particulate matter [less than/equal to] 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(2.5))/PM(10). This finding did not change with the inclusion of a number of potential confounders and effect modifiers, although there is some evidence that PM effects are influenced by climate, housing characteristics, demographics, and the presence of sulfur dioxide and ozone. Although further analysis would be needed to determine which factors causally influence the relationship between PM(10) and mortality, these findings can help guide future epidemiologic investigations and policy decisions.",https://openalex.org/W2145880514,https://openalex.org/W2145880514

Temporal, spatial, and causal expansion of information",https://doi.org/10.1029/2007wr006744,Ralf Merz; Günter Blöschl,2008,,"The hydrological literature on flood frequency analysis in the past has placed undue emphasis on solving the estimation problem. In this paper we argue that much better use should be made of the wealth of hydrological knowledge gained in the past century and that it is essential to expand the information beyond the flood sample at the site of interest. We suggest that the expansion of information can be grouped into three types: temporal, spatial, and causal. We present a number of examples from Austria to illustrate the rich diversity of flood processes that are often site specific and difficult to capture by formal methods. On the basis of these examples, and the expansion of information, we illustrate that hydrological reasoning can provide diagnostic findings that give guidance on how to adjust quantitative estimates from formal methods to more fully capture the subtleties of the flood characteristics at the site of interest. We believe that this approach gives a more complete representation of flood processes at a given site than the existing formal methods alone and propose the term “flood frequency hydrology,” as opposed to flood frequency statistics, to reflect the focus on hydrological processes and hydrological reasoning.",https://openalex.org/W1598372991,https://openalex.org/W1598372991

Smith; Zhnongwei Liu,2012,,"In this article, we present the results of a study investigating the influence of vulnerability to climate change as a function of physical vulnerability, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity on climate change risk perception. In 2008/2009, we surveyed Nevada ranchers and farmers to assess their climate change‐related beliefs, and risk perceptions, political orientations, and socioeconomic characteristics. Ranchers’ and farmers’ sensitivity to climate change was measured through estimating the proportion of their household income originating from highly scarce water‐dependent agriculture to the total income. Adaptive capacity was measured as a combination of the Social Status Index and the Poverty Index. Utilizing water availability and use, and population distribution GIS databases; we assessed water resource vulnerability in Nevada by zip code as an indicator of physical vulnerability to climate change. We performed correlation tests and multiple regression analyses to examine the impact of vulnerability and its three distinct components on risk perception. We find that vulnerability is not a significant determinant of risk perception. Physical vulnerability alone also does not impact risk perception. Both sensitivity and adaptive capacity increase risk perception. While age is not a significant determinant of it, gender plays an important role in shaping risk perception. Yet, general beliefs such as political orientations and climate change‐specific beliefs such as believing in the anthropogenic causes of climate change and connecting the locally observed impacts (in this case drought) to climate change are the most prominent determinants of risk perception.",https://openalex.org/W2144653265,https://openalex.org/W2144653265

Hierarchical linear models were used to examine this hypothesis across 2 weeks of daily activity and well-being reports controlling for trait-level individual differences. Results strongly supported the hypothesis. The authors also examined the social activities that contribute to satisfaction of relatedness needs. The best predictors were meaningful talk and feeling understood and appreciated by interaction partners. Finally, the authors found systematic day-of-the-week variations in emotional well-being and need satisfaction.

Infectious disease risk and international tourism demand,https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czw177,Jaume Rosselló; María Santana-Gallego; Aon Waqas Awan,2016,,"For some countries, favourable climatic conditions for tourism are often associated with favourable conditions for infectious diseases, with the ensuing development constraints on the tourist sectors of impoverished countries where tourism's economic contribution has a high potential. This paper evaluates the economic implications of eradication of Malaria, Dengue, Yellow Fever and Ebola on the affected destination countries focusing on the tourist expenditures. A gravity model for international tourism flows is used to provide an estimation of the impact of each travel-related disease on international tourist arrivals. Next the potential eradication of these diseases in the affected countries is simulated and the impact on tourism expenditures is estimated. The results show that, in the case of Malaria, Dengue, Yellow Fever and Ebola, the eradication of these diseases in the affected countries would result in an increase of around 10 million of tourist worldwide and a rise in the tourism expenditure of 12 billion dollars. By analysing the economic benefits of the eradication of Dengue, Ebola, Malaria, and Yellow Fever for the tourist sector-a strategic economic sector for many of the countries where these TRD are present-this paper explores a new aspect of the quantification of health policies which should be taken into consideration in future international health assessment programmes. It is important to note that the analysis is only made of the direct impact of the diseases' eradication and consequently the potential multiplicative effects of a growth in the GDP, in terms of tourism attractiveness, are not evaluated. Consequently, the economic results can be considered to be skeleton ones.",https://openalex.org/W2577310482,https://openalex.org/W2577310482

Determinants are positioned at the individual and/or couple level (micro-level), social relationships and social networks (meso-level); and, by cultural and institutional settings (macro-level). The focus is both on the quantum and on the tempo of fertility, with a particular focus on the postponement of childbearing.

These challenges include depletion of natural resources, globalization challenges, and environmental degradation. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economies are rich in mineral resources. Economic globalization has put the MENA countries in the spotlight for the developed world. Despite the status of being a hotspot for mineral resource richness, there is limited research on the effect of natural resources and economic globalization on the environmental degradation of the MENA countries. This paper examines the effects of natural resource abundance and economic globalization on environmental quality by considering trade openness, urbanization, and economic growth from the year 1980 to 2018. We apply second‐generation panel cointegration techniques along with continuously updated fully modified (Cup‐FM) and continuously updated bias‐corrected (Cup‐BC) techniques. The findings show that natural resource abundance significantly improves environmental quality. Likewise, economic globalization also mitigates emissions levels in the MENA countries. In contrast, trade openness, urbanization, and economic growth significantly deteriorate environmental quality. The unidirectional link indicates natural resources and economic globalization create trade openness. The paper provides novel empirical evidence and policy recommendations for sustainable development goals.",https://openalex.org/W3160762380,https://openalex.org/W3160762380
Causal Discovery for Climate Research Using Graphical Models,https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-11-00387.1,Imme Ebert‐Uphoff; Yi Deng,2012,,"Abstract Causal discovery seeks to recover cause–effect relationships from statistical data using graphical models. One goal of this paper is to provide an accessible introduction to causal discovery methods for climate scientists, with a focus on constraint-based structure learning. Second, in a detailed case study constraint-based structure learning is applied to derive hypotheses of causal relationships between four prominent modes of atmospheric low-frequency variability in boreal winter including the Western Pacific Oscillation (WPO), Eastern Pacific Oscillation (EPO), Pacific–North America (PNA) pattern, and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The results are shown in the form of static and temporal independence graphs also known as Bayesian Networks. It is found that WPO and EPO are nearly indistinguishable from the cause–effect perspective as strong simultaneous coupling is identified between the two. In addition, changes in the state of EPO (NAO) may cause changes in the state of NAO (PNA) approximately 18 (3–6) days later. These results are not only consistent with previous findings on dynamical processes connecting different low-frequency modes (e.g., interaction between synoptic and low-frequency eddies) but also provide the basis for formulating new hypotheses regarding the time scale and temporal sequencing of dynamical processes responsible for these connections. Last, the authors propose to use structure learning for climate networks, which are currently based primarily on correlation analysis. While correlation-based climate networks focus on similarity between nodes, independence graphs would provide an alternative viewpoint by focusing on information flow in the network.",https://openalex.org/W2071312622,https://openalex.org/W2071312622

We show that an already marginalized group—female-headed households in South Africa—is differentially affected by relatively modest levels of variation in rainfall, which households experience on a year-to-year basis. Data from three waves of the National Income Dynamics Survey in South Africa allow us to follow incomes of 4,162 households from 2006 to 2012. By observing how household income is affected by variation in rainfall relative to what is normally experienced during the rainy season in each district, our study employs a series of naturally occurring experiments that allow us to identify causal effects. We find that households where a single head can be identified based on residency or work status are more vulnerable to climate variability than households headed by two adults. Single male-headed households are more vulnerable because of lower initial earnings and, to a lesser extent, other household characteristics that contribute to economic disadvantages. However, this can only explain some of the differential vulnerability of female-headed households. This suggests that there are traits specific to female-headed households, such as limited access to protective social networks or other coping strategies, which makes this an important dimension of marginalization to consider for further research and policy in South Africa and other national contexts. Households headed by widows, never-married women, and women with a non-resident spouse (e.g., “left-behind” migrant households) are particularly vulnerable. We find vulnerable households only in districts where rainfall has a large effect on agricultural yields, and female-headed households remain vulnerable when accounting for dynamic impacts of rainfall on income.",https://openalex.org/W2523370331,https://openalex.org/W2523370331

Treating hearing loss with hearing aids may ameliorate cognitive decline. The purpose of this study was to test whether use of hearing aids was associated with better cognitive performance, and if this relationship was mediated via social isolation and/or depression. Structural equation modelling of associations between hearing loss, cognitive performance, social isolation, depression and hearing aid use was carried out with a subsample of the UK Biobank data set (n = 164,770) of UK adults aged 40 to 69 years who completed a hearing test. Age, sex, general health and socioeconomic status were controlled for as potential confounders. Hearing aid use was associated with better cognition, independently of social isolation and depression. This finding was consistent with the hypothesis that hearing aids may improve cognitive performance, although if hearing aids do have a positive effect on cognition it is not likely to be via reduction of the adverse effects of hearing loss on social isolation or depression. We suggest that any positive effects of hearing aid use on cognition may be via improvement in audibility or associated increases in self-efficacy. Alternatively, positive associations between hearing aid use and cognition may be accounted for by more cognitively able people seeking and using hearing aids. Further research is required to determine the direction of association, if there is any direct causal relationship between hearing aid use and better cognition, and whether hearing aid use results in reduction in rates of cognitive decline measured longitudinally.",https://openalex.org/W2099623128,https://openalex.org/W2099623128

Conversely, two of the world's leading economic geographers – Allen Scott and Michael Storper – have strongly argued that job availability not household amenities have determined US regional dynamics.

This does not only challenge scientific progress, but also raises the question of whether they measure one identical concept with different methods or whether they measure different understandings of resilience. This paper provides a review of concepts, methodological approaches and empirical evidence on resilience from a food security perspective, focusing on socio-economic research. We perform a systematic literature search to identify recent publications that analyze resilience from the perspective of household food security. We examine the historical evolution of concepts and methods used for measuring resilience and synthesize the evidence. We find that conceptual and analytical models have evolved over time, with important technical adjustments. Studies initially focused on measuring resilience as an end in itself, but more recently resilience is understood as a means to an ultimate end, hence resilience capacity is measured instead. Also, resilience was initially measured as an indicator of food security. Currently it is measured distinctly from food security. Multivariate techniques are found to be frequently used to quantify resilience. The empirical evidence suggests that households with higher resilience capacity tend to have less child malnutrition and better food security. We find that causal pathways through which resilience capacity affects food security in a microeconomic framework are barely explicitly considered in empirical analyses. Therefore, we suggest a model which explicitly addresses these pathways.",https://openalex.org/W2970759669,https://openalex.org/W2970759669

Encountering climate change: ‘seeing’ is more than ‘believing’,https://doi.org/10.1002/wcc.286,Joseph P. Reser; Graham L. Bradley; Michelle Ellul,2014,,"Individuals' direct exposure to and experience of climate change are arguably integral aspects of their risk perceptions, understandings, and engagement with the issue. Recent research investigating these experiences has thrown into sharp relief some fundamental considerations with respect to public risk perceptions and responses, in particular the extent to which such perceived encounters might reflect a priori beliefs and motivated reasoning. Findings to date are intriguing and compelling, both in regard to the escalating percentages of individuals who report having such personal encounters, and conclusions being drawn with respect to the nature, significance, and influence of such direct experience. These findings have also led to some intuitively reasonable but possibly problematic recommendations regarding policy and issue and behavioural engagement implications. A focus on underlying processes of experience and belief, oversimplified in terms of ‘seeing’ or ‘believing’, has however deflected attention from other issues such as the nature and contexts of individual climate change encounters, the clarity of the constructs and validity of the measures being used for ‘belief’ and ‘experience’, and the transactional and phenomenological nature of climate change encounters. There is nonetheless current and convergent evidence that perceived direct experience of environmental changes or events deemed to be manifestations of climate change influences psychological responses such as risk perception, acceptance, belief certainty, distress, and psychological and behavioural adaptation. These findings suggest that such experiences, for many, foster a contextualized and more personally meaningful realisation of what climate change portends, implies, and ultimately means, locally and globally.

Combining Evidence on Air Pollution and Daily Mortality from the 20 Largest US Cities: A Hierarchical Modelling Strategy,https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-985x.00170,Francesca Dominici; Jonathan M. Samet; Scott L. Zeger,2000,,"Summary Reports over the last decade of association between levels of particles in outdoor air and daily mortality counts have raised concern that air pollution shortens life, even at concentrations within current regulatory limits. Criticisms of these reports have focused on the statistical techniques that are used to estimate the pollution–mortality relationship and the inconsistency in findings between cities. We have developed analytical methods that address these concerns and combine evidence from multiple locations to gain a unified analysis of the data. The paper presents log-linear regression analyses of daily time series data from the largest 20 US cities and introduces hierarchical regression models for combining estimates of the pollution–mortality relationship across cities. We illustrate this method by focusing on mortality effects of PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter) and by performing univariate and bivariate analyses with PM10 and ozone (O3) level. In the first stage of the hierarchical model, we estimate the relative mortality rate associated with PM10 for each of the 20 cities by using semiparametric log-linear models. The second stage of the model describes between-city variation in the true relative rates as a function of selected city-specific covariates. We also fit two variations of a spatial model with the goal of exploring the spatial correlation of the pollutant-specific coefficients among cities. Finally, to explore the results of considering the two pollutants jointly, we fit and compare univariate and bivariate models. All posterior distributions from the second stage are estimated by using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. In univariate analyses using concurrent day pollution values to predict mortality, we find that an increase of 10 μg m-3 in PM10 on average in the USA is associated with a 0.48% increase in mortality (95% interval: 0.05, 0.92). With adjustment for the O3 level the PM10-coefficient is slightly higher. The results are largely insensitive to the specific choice of vague but proper prior distribution. The models and estimation methods are general and can be used for any number of locations and pollutant measurements and have potential applications to other environmental agents.",https://openalex.org/W2046863970,https://openalex.org/W2046863970

Neuroeconomics: How Neuroscience Can Inform Economics,https://doi.org/10.1257/0022051053737843,Colin F. Camerer; George Loewenstein; Dražen Prelec,2005,,"Neuroeconomics uses knowledge about brain mechanisms to inform economic analysis, and roots economics in biology. It opens up the “black box” of the brain, much as organizational economics adds detail to the theory of the firm. Neuroscientists use many tools— including brain imaging, behavior of patients with localized brain lesions, animal behavior, and recording single neuron activity. The key insight for economics is that the brain is composed of multiple systems which interact. Controlled systems (“executive function”) interrupt automatic ones. Emotions and cognition both guide decisions. Just as prices and allocations emerge from the interaction of two processes—supply and demand— individual decisions can be modeled as the result of two (or more) processes interacting. Indeed, “dual-process” models of this sort are better rooted in neuroscientific fact, and more empirically accurate, than single-process models (such as utility-maximization). We discuss how brain evidence complicates standard assumptions about basic preference, to include homeostasis and other kinds of state-dependence. We also discuss applications to intertemporal choice, risk and decision making, and game theory. Intertemporal choice appears to be domain-specific and heavily influenced by emotion. The simplified ß-d of quasi-hyperbolic discounting is supported by activation in distinct regions of limbic and cortical systems. In risky decision, imaging data tentatively support the idea that gains and losses are coded separately, and that ambiguity is distinct from risk, because it activates fear and discomfort regions. (Ironically, lesion patients who do not receive fear signals in prefrontal cortex are “rationally” neutral toward ambiguity.) Game theory studies show the effect of brain regions implicated in “theory of mind”, correlates of strategic skill, and effects of hormones and other biological variables. Finally, economics can contribute to neuroscience because simple rational-choice models are useful for understanding highly-evolved behavior like motor actions that earn rewards, and Bayesian integration of sensorimotor information. Who knows what I want to do? Who knows what anyone wants to do? How can you be sure about something like that? Isn't it all a question of brain chemistry, signals going back and forth, electrical energy in the cortex? How do you know whether something is really what you want to do or just some kind of nerve impulse in the brain. Some minor little activity takes place somewhere in this unimportant place in one of the brain hemispheres and suddenly I want to go to Montana or I don't want to go to Montana.

We propose an alternative, data centric, approach that relies on actual measurements of climate observations and human and natural forcing factors. Specifically, we develop a novel method to infer causality from spatial-temporal data, as well as a procedure to incorporate extreme value modeling into our method in order to address the attribution of extreme climate events, such as heatwaves. Our experimental results on a real world dataset indicate that changes in temperature are not solely accounted for by solar radiance, but attributed more significantly to CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Combined with extreme value modeling, we also show that there has been a significant increase in the intensity of extreme temperatures, and that such changes in extreme temperature are also attributable to greenhouse gases. These preliminary results suggest that our approach can offer a useful alternative to the simulation-based approach to climate modeling and attribution, and provide valuable insights from a fresh perspective.",https://openalex.org/W2051148835,https://openalex.org/W2051148835
Coping with stress during childhood and adolescence.,https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.101.3.393,Bruce E. Compas,1987,,"In this article, research on how children and adolescents cope with stress and coping's role in reducing the adverse psychological states associated with stress is reviewed. Child and adolescent coping is reflected in seven different lines of research—infa nts' responses to maternal separation, social support, interpersonal cognitive problem-solving, coping in achievement contexts, Type A behavior pattern in children, repression-sensitization, and resilience to stress. A variety of different coping resources, styles, and specific strategies are important in successfully adapting to stress, including efforts that focus directly on the problem, as well as attempts to deal with adverse emotions associated with stress. Directions for future research are identified, emphasizing the need for more systematic comparisons of coping across different types of stress and over time in response to a single stressful episode. A central feature of human development involves coping with psychosocial stress. Beginning in infancy, individuals are confronted with a stream of potentially threatening and challenging situations that require action and adaptation. The modest to moderate correlations typically found between stressful life events and disorder during childhood and adolescence suggest that individual difference factors related to coping may moderate the stress-disorder relation (see Compas, in press, for a review). The resources available to cope with stress and the manner in which individuals actually cope may be important factors influencing patterns of positive growth and development as opposed to the onset of a host of psychological and somatic problems. Although the study of coping with stress during adulthood has been characterized by increasing convergence in conceptualization and measurement (e.g., Lazarus & Folkman, 1984; Menaghan, 1983; Moos & Billings, 1982), this is not true for coping during childhood and adolescence. Instead, coping in younger age groups has been represented by different definitions and methods of measurement, as well as several divergent lines of research. The purpose of this review is to integrate these somewhat disparate areas of research and to identify future directions for study. First, various definitions and conceptualizations of coping are discussed. Second, empirical studies of coping during childhood and adolescence are reviewed. Finally, conclusions drawn from this research, the major issues facing the field, and directions for future research are outlined.",https://openalex.org/W2016118916,https://openalex.org/W2016118916
Global Climate Change: National Security Implications,https://doi.org/10.21236/ada480687,Carolyn W. Pumphrey,2008,,"Abstract : 1 INTRODUCTION Carolyn Pumphrey Triangle Institute for Security Studies The Evolution of a Problem. Until fairly recent times no one thought climate changed, let alone was influenced by human activities. By the 19th century, scientists were theorizing that temperatures were affected by what we now call greenhouse gasses. And in the late 19th century, the Swedish scientist Arrhenius suggested that human industry might cause the planet to warm. But this notion was generally scoffed at. Over the course of the 20th century, the scientific community gradually came to terms with this theory and began to regard climate change even rapid climate change as more than a distant possibility. Interest in climate change as a national security issue developed even later. Although the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) did commission a study to look into the security implications of climate change in the late 1970s, the issue had little resonance until the late 1990s when the Senate Armed Services Committee declared that environmental destruction, including global warming, was a growing national security threat. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was created in 1995 in part to allay fears. And then, in 2003, the rather notorious report commissioned by the Pentagon, An Abrupt Climate Change Scenario and its Implications for United States National Security, provided a worst-case scenario, which suggested that climate change might have a catastrophic impact, leading to rioting and nuclear war.",https://openalex.org/W241766827,https://openalex.org/W241766827
Spatially Extended Tests of a Neural Network Parametrization Trained by Coarse‐Graining,https://doi.org/10.1029/2019ms001711,Noah Brenowitz; Christopher S. Bretherton,2019,,"Abstract General circulation models (GCMs) typically have a grid size of 25–200 km. Parametrizations are used to represent diabatic processes such as radiative transfer and cloud microphysics and account for subgrid‐scale motions and variability. Unlike traditional approaches, neural networks (NNs) can readily exploit recent observational data sets and global cloud‐system resolving model (CRM) simulations to learn subgrid variability. This article describes an NN parametrization trained by coarse‐graining a near‐global CRM simulation with a 4‐km horizontal grid spacing. The NN predicts the residual heating and moistening averaged over (160 km) 2 grid boxes as a function of the coarse‐resolution fields within the same atmospheric column. This NN is coupled to the dynamical core of a GCM with the same 160‐km resolution. A recent study described how to train such an NN to be stable when coupled to specified time‐evolving advective forcings in a single‐column model, but feedbacks between NN and GCM components cause spatially extended simulations to crash within a few days. Analyzing the linearized response of such an NN reveals that it learns to exploit a strong synchrony between precipitation and the atmospheric state above 10 km. Removing these variables from the NN's inputs stabilizes the coupled simulations, which predict the future state more accurately than a coarse‐resolution simulation without any parametrizations of subgrid‐scale variability, although the mean state slowly drifts.",https://openalex.org/W3100642145,https://openalex.org/W3100642145

The Whitehall Study documented a social gradient in mortality rates, even among people who are not poor, and this pattern has been confirmed by data from the United States and elsewhere. The social gradient in health is influenced by such factors as social position; relative versus absolute deprivation; and control and social participation.

Airborne particles were associated with significant increases in daily deaths [0.67% increase for a 10 microg/m(3) increase in particles; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.52-0.81%]. This association was the same in summer and winter. To examine potential confounding by other pollutants, I regressed city- and season-specific effect sizes against the relationship between airborne particles and other pollutants. Controlling for other pollutants did not substantially (or significantly) change the estimated effect of airborne particles. Socioeconomic differences between cities likewise did not modify the effect. The increase in daily deaths that occurred out of hospitals (0.89% per 10 microg/m(3); CI, 0.67-1.10%) was substantially greater than the increase in deaths in hospitals (0. 49%; CI, 0.31-0.68%). This is consistent with results previously reported in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and suggests that the particle-associated deaths are not just being brought forward by a few days. It is also consistent with recent animal and human studies of the mechanisms of particle toxicity.",https://openalex.org/W2028676928,https://openalex.org/W2028676928

Christakis,2009,,"Objectives. We examined the effects of community socioeconomic conditions, air pollution, and the physical environment on elderly health and survival in China. Methods. We analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of 15 973 elderly residents of 866 counties and cities with multilevel logistic regression models in which individuals were nested within each county or city. Results. After control for individual-level factors, communities' gross domestic product per capita, adult labor force participation rate, and illiteracy rate were significantly associated with physical, mental, and overall health and mortality among the elderly in China. We also found that air pollution increased the odds of disability in activities of daily living (ADLs), cognitive impairment, and health deficits; more rainfall was protective, reducing the odds of ADL disability and cognitive impairment; low seasonal temperatures increased the odds of ADL disability and mortality; high seasonal temperatures increased the odds of cognitive impairment and deficits; and living in hilly areas decreased the odds of ADL disability and health deficits. Conclusions. Efforts to reduce pollution and improve socioeconomic conditions could significantly improve elderly health and survival.",https://openalex.org/W2114388995,https://openalex.org/W2114388995

Neighborhood Effects on Economic Self‐Sufficiency: A Reconsideration of the Moving to Opportunity Experiment,https://doi.org/10.1086/588740,Susan Clampet‐Lundquist; Douglas S. Massey,2008,,"This article revisits the Moving to Opportunity housing mobility experiment, which heretofore has not provided strong evidence to support the hypothesis of neighborhood effects on economic self‐sufficiency among adults. The authors undertake a conceptual and empirical analysis of the study's design and implementation to gain a better understanding of the selection processes that occur within the study. The article shows that the study is potentially affected by selectivity at several junctures: in determining who complied with the program's requirements, who entered integrated versus segregated neighborhoods, and who left neighborhoods after initial relocation. Furthermore, previous researchers have not found an experimental treatment effect on adult economic self‐sufficiency, relative to controls. The authors propose an alternative approach that involves measuring the cumulative amount of time spent in different neighborhood environments. With this method, they find evidence that neighborhood is associated with outcomes such as employment, earnings, TANF receipt, and use of food stamps.",https://openalex.org/W1550044200,https://openalex.org/W1550044200

Accordingly, in the present study, various powertrain systems and topologies of (plug-in) hybrid electric vehicles and full-electric vehicles are assessed. In addition, EMSs as applied in the literature are systematically surveyed for a qualitative investigation, classification, and comparison of existing approaches in terms of the principles, advantages, and drawbacks through a comprehensive review.

Our review of this growing literature indicates areas where data are substantial and where much more research is needed. We conclude that SWB can sometimes influence health, and review a number of reasons why it does so. A key open question is when it does and does not do so—in terms of populations likely to be affected, types of SWB that are most influential (including which might be harmful), and types of health and illnesses that are most likely to be affected. We also describe additional types of research that are now much needed in this burgeoning area of interest, for example, cross‐cultural studies, animal research, and experimental interventions designed to raise long‐term SWB and assess the effects on physical health.

Goldberg; Alan R. Schwartz; PHILIP L. SMITH,2002,,"Sleep-disordered breathing is a prevalent condition associated with impairment of daytime function and may predispose individuals to metabolic abnormalities independent of obesity. The primary objective of this study was to determine the metabolic consequences and community prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing in mildly obese, but otherwise healthy, individuals. One hundred and fifty healthy men, without diabetes or cardiopulmonary disease, were recruited from the community. Measurements included polysomnography, a multiple sleep latency test, an oral glucose tolerance test, determination of body fat by hydrodensitometry, and fasting insulin and lipids. The prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing, depending on the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) cutoff, ranged from 40 to 60%. After adjusting for body mass index (BMI) and percent body fat, an AHI ⩾ 5 events/h was associated with an increased risk of having impaired or diabetic glucose tolerance (odds ratio, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.05–4.38). The impairment in glucose tolerance was related to the severity of oxygen desaturation ( Δ SaO2 ) associated with sleep-disordered breathing. For a 4% decrease in oxygen saturation, the associated odds ratio for worsening glucose tolerance was 1.99 (95% CI, 1.11 to 3.56) after adjusting for percent body fat, BMI, and AHI. Multivariable linear regression analyses revealed that increasing AHI was associated with worsening insulin resistance independent of obesity. Thus, sleep-disordered breathing is a prevalent condition in mildly obese men and is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance.",https://openalex.org/W2063135200,https://openalex.org/W2063135200

Constraining the aerosol influence on cloud fraction,https://doi.org/10.1002/2015jd023744,Edward Gryspeerdt; Johannes Quaas; Nicolas Bellouin,2016,,"Abstract Aerosol‐cloud interactions have the potential to modify many different cloud properties. There is significant uncertainty in the strength of these aerosol‐cloud interactions in analyses of observational data, partly due to the difficulty in separating aerosol effects on clouds from correlations generated by local meteorology. The relationship between aerosol and cloud fraction (CF) is particularly important to determine, due to the strong correlation of CF to other cloud properties and its large impact on radiation. It has also been one of the hardest to quantify from satellites due to the strong meteorological covariations involved. This work presents a new method to analyze the relationship between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and CF. By including information about the cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), the impact of the meteorological covariations is significantly reduced. This method shows that much of the AOD‐CF correlation is explained by relationships other than that mediated by CDNC. By accounting for these, the strength of the global mean AOD‐CF relationship is reduced by around 80%. This suggests that the majority of the AOD‐CF relationship is due to meteorological covariations, especially in the shallow cumulus regime. Requiring CDNC to mediate the AOD‐CF relationship implies an effective anthropogenic radiative forcing from an aerosol influence on liquid CF of −0.48 W m −2 (−0.1 to −0.64 W m −2 ), although some uncertainty remains due to possible biases in the CDNC retrievals in broken cloud scenes.",https://openalex.org/W2299943051,https://openalex.org/W2299943051
The economic costs of Hurricane Harvey attributable to climate change,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-020-02692-8,David J. Frame; Michael Wehner; Ilan Noy; Suzanne M. Rosier,2020,,"Abstract Hurricane Harvey is one of the costliest tropical cyclones in history. In this paper, we use a probabilistic event attribution framework to estimate the costs associated with Hurricane Harvey that are attributable to anthropogenic influence on the climate system. Results indicate that the “fraction of attributable risk” for the rainfall from Harvey was likely about at least a third with a preferable/best estimate of three quarters. With an average estimate of damages from Harvey assessed at about US$90bn, applying this fraction gives a best estimate of US$67bn, with a likely lower bound of at least US$30bn, of these damages that are attributable to the human influence on climate. This “bottom-up” event-based estimate of climate change damages contrasts sharply with the more “top-down” approach using integrated assessment models (IAMs) or global macroeconometric estimates: one IAM estimates annual climate change damages in the USA to be in the region of US$21.3bn. While the two approaches are not easily comparable, it is noteworthy that our “bottom-up” results estimate that one single extreme weather event contributes more to climate change damages in the USA than an entire year by the “top-down” method. Given that the “top-down” approach, at best, parameterizes but does not resolve the effects of extreme weather events, our findings suggest that the “bottom-up” approach is a useful avenue to pursue in future attempts to refine estimates of climate change damages.",https://openalex.org/W3016076986,https://openalex.org/W3016076986

Changes in atmosphere and/or landscape characteristics modify the earth's metabolism through changes in its biogeochemical cycles. The most basic of these is the water cycle which directly affects the global circulation of both atmosphere and ocean and hence is instrumental in shaping weather and climate. Defining the spatial extent of the environmental impact of a local land surface change, or identifying, for forecasting purposes, the location and nature of climatic anomalies that may be causally linked to local hydrologic persistencies requires global scale dynamic modeling of the coupled ocean‐atmosphere‐land surface. Development, evaluation, verification, and use of these models requires the active participation of hydrologists along with a wide range of other earth scientists.

Connecting the Dots: Identifying Network Structure via Graph Signal Processing,https://doi.org/10.1109/msp.2018.2890143,Gonzalo Mateos; Santiago Segarra; Antonio G. Marqués; Alejandro Ribeiro,2019,,"Network topology inference is a prominent problem in Network Science. Most graph signal processing (GSP) efforts to date assume that the underlying network is known, and then analyze how the graph's algebraic and spectral characteristics impact the properties of the graph signals of interest. Such an assumption is often untenable beyond applications dealing with e.g., directly observable social and infrastructure networks; and typically adopted graph construction schemes are largely informal, distinctly lacking an element of validation. This tutorial offers an overview of graph learning methods developed to bridge the aforementioned gap, by using information available from graph signals to infer the underlying graph topology. Fairly mature statistical approaches are surveyed first, where correlation analysis takes center stage along with its connections to covariance selection and high-dimensional regression for learning Gaussian graphical models. Recent GSP-based network inference frameworks are also described, which postulate that the network exists as a latent underlying structure, and that observations are generated as a result of a network process defined in such a graph. A number of arguably more nascent topics are also briefly outlined, including inference of dynamic networks, nonlinear models of pairwise interaction, as well as extensions to directed graphs and their relation to causal inference. All in all, this paper introduces readers to challenges and opportunities for signal processing research in emerging topic areas at the crossroads of modeling, prediction, and control of complex behavior arising in networked systems that evolve over time.",https://openalex.org/W2994097903,https://openalex.org/W2994097903

Despite the human origin of most of these fires, little is known of how environmental and socioeconomic variables contribute to the spatial patterns of fire incidence and burned areas. The tropical Mexican State of Chiapas represents a good case study to analyze these interactions, due to the availability of official data, and its similarities to other tropical countries, in terms of environmental and socioeconomic characteristics. This study evaluates the relative importance of human-related and environmental variables in determining the distribution of the number of fires and area burned in the tropical State of Chiapas in years of normal and extreme climatic conditions (non-El Niño vs. El Niño). We have searched for causal relationships among fire, environmental, and socioeconomic variables in Chiapas using path analysis. Results of this study show a major importance of environmental variables in non-El Niño years, suggesting that the status of the vegetation was the main cause determining fire ignition and fire spread in these years. Contrarily, the observed trends in the El Niño period indicate that fire trends were mainly determined by the presence of ignition agents. In these El Niño years, vegetation is so severely water stressed that, when fire starts, all vegetation types burn, regardless of their flammability properties. The main vegetation types affected by fire in non-El Niño years were the most flammable ones, such as pine–oak communities, while rainforests burned the most in El Niño years. Altitude, pine–oak communities, and poverty levels played major roles in the arboreal fire incidence in non-El Niño years, whereas the distribution of pastures appeared as an important variable determining arboreal fire incidence in El Niño years. When all fires were considered (affecting any vegetation layer), almost identical trends were observed, with the incorporation of a new variable influencing the area burned: density of infrastructure. The results of this study strengthen the importance of El Niño years in the conservation of rainforest ecosystems and suggest the existence of synergistic effects involving fires, fragmentation, and certain elements of the landscape, such as cattle pastures, in tropical areas.",https://openalex.org/W2115105088,https://openalex.org/W2115105088

To address the potential variability of the responses of alpine ecosystems to climate change, we examined daily CO 2 exchange in relation to major environmental variables. A dataset was obtained from an alpine meadow on the Qinghai‐Tibetan Plateau from eddy covariance measurements taken over 3 years (2002–2004). Path analysis showed that soil temperature at 5 cm depth ( T s5 ) had the greatest effect on daily variation in ecosystem CO 2 exchange all year around, whereas photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) had a high direct effect on daily variation in CO 2 flux during the growing season. The combined effects of temperature and light regimes on net ecosystem CO 2 exchange (NEE) could be clearly categorized into three areas depending on the change in T s5 : (1) almost no NEE change irrespective of variations in light and temperature when T s5 was below 0 °C; (2) an NEE increase (i.e. CO 2 released from the ecosystem) with increasing T s5 , but little response to variation in light regime when 0 °C≤ T s5 ≤8 °C; and (3) an NEE decrease with increase in T s5 and PPFD when T s5 was approximately &gt;8 °C. The highest daily net ecosystem CO 2 uptake was observed under the conditions of daily mean T s5 of about 15 °C and daily mean PPFD of about 50 mol m −2 day −1 .

"Geologic Life: Prehistory, Climate, Futures in the Anthropocene",https://doi.org/10.1068/d11512,Kathryn Yusoff,2013,,"The diagnostic of the Anthropocene proposes a new geological epoch that designates humans as beings capable of geomorphic force, shaping Earth systems on a par with inhuman forces. This social geology marks an ascendance to inhuman planetary power fuelled by fossil fuels from the Carboniferous. Yet nowhere are the geophysical, genomic, and social narratives of this geologic subjectification considered together to interrogate these geologic capacities, not just in terms of impacts on the Earth, but as forces that subjects share—geologic forces that compose and differentiate corporeal and collective biopolitical formations. I argue in this paper that the concept of the Anthropocene is axiomatic of new understandings of time, matter, and agency for the human as a collective being and as a subject capable of geomorphic acts; a being that not just affects geology, but is an intemperate force within it. This immersion of humanity into geologic time suggests both a remineralisation of the origins of the human and a shift in the human timescale from biological life course to that of epoch and species—life. The paper is structured as a modest conversation between two fossilised subjects that define the imagined origin and ending of the narrative arc of the Anthropocene—one from the prehistory of human origins, the other from the future of the Anthropocene—in a conversation about time, geology, and inhuman becomings. Examining fossils as material and discursive knots in the narrative arc of human becoming, I argue for a ‘geological turn’ that takes seriously not just our biological (or biopolitical) life, but also our geological (or geopolitical) life and its forms of differentiation. Fossils unlock this life—death, time—untimely, corporeal—incorporeal equation, suggesting the need for a theory of the geologic and a reckoning with the forces of mute matter in lively bodies: a corporeality that is driven by inhuman forces. This paper investigates what I am calling “geologic life”—a mineralogical dimension of human composition that remains currently undertheorised in social thought and is directly relevant for the material, temporal, and corporeal conceptualisation of fossil fuels. This geologic life prompts a need to rethink the coherency of the human as a territorialising force of the Earth in its prehistoric, contemporary, and future-orientated incarnation. As such, this paper proposes a speculative theoretical framework for thinking modes of geologic life within the Anthropocene.",https://openalex.org/W2022317275,https://openalex.org/W2022317275
Mental models concepts for system dynamics research,https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1727(199821)14:1<3::aid-sdr140>3.0.co;2-k,James K. Doyle; David N. Ford,1998,,"Although ""mental models"" are of central importance to system dynamics research and practice, the field has yet to develop an unambiguous and agreed upon definition of them. To begin to address this problem, existing definitions and descriptions of mental models in system dynamics and several literatures related to cognitive science were reviewed and compared. Available definitions were found to be overly brief, general, and vague, and different authors were found to markedly disagree on the basic characteristics of mental models. Based on this review, we concluded that in order to reduce the amount of confusion in the literature, the mental models concept should be ""unbundled"" and the term ""mental models"" should be used more narrowly. To initiate a dialogue through which the system dynamics community might achieve a shared understanding of mental models, we propose a new definition of ""mental models of dynamic systems"" accompanied by an extended annotation that explains the definitional choices made and suggests terms for other cognitive structures left undefined by narrowing the mental model concept. Suggestions for future research that could improve the field's ability to further define mental models are discussed. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",https://openalex.org/W2100650984,https://openalex.org/W2100650984

We investigated relationships between VRs and IA in California elementary schools over two school years in 162 3rd-5th-grade classrooms in 28 schools in three school districts: South Coast (SC), Bay Area (BA), and Central Valley (CV). We estimated relationships between daily IA and VR (estimated from two year daily real-time carbon dioxide in each classroom) in zero-inflated negative binomial models. We also compared IA benefits and energy costs of increased VRs. All school districts had median VRs below the 7.1 l/s-person California standard. For each additional 1 l/s-person of VR, IA was reduced significantly (p<0.05) in models for combined districts (-1.6%) and for SC (-1.2%), and nonsignificantly for districts providing less data: BA (-1.5%) and CV (-1.0%). Assuming associations were causal and generalizable, increasing classroom VRs from the California average (4 l/s-person) to the State standard would decrease IA by 3.4%, increase attendance-linked funding to schools by $33 million annually, and increase costs by only $4 million. Further increasing VRs would provide additional benefits. These findings, while requiring confirmation, suggest that increasing classroom VRs above the State standard would substantially decrease illness absence and produce economic benefits.",https://openalex.org/W2152742836,https://openalex.org/W2152742836

Malamud; Hugo Winter; Amélie Joly-Laugel,2019,,"Globally and yearly, individual hazards and hazard interrelations have the potential to result in socio-economic losses. Here, in this critical review, we use grey- and peer-review literature to identify and compare current research available for the quantification of hazard interrelations, focussing on 14 different natural hazards. We first provide a historical context for quantitative single hazard and multi-hazard assessment. We then construct a literature database with 146 references related to multi-hazard interrelations. We use our literature database to identify trends for hazard interrelation and multi-hazard and from these group hazard interrelations into five types: triggering, change condition, compound, independence and mutually exclusive. Our critical review identifies 19 different modelling methods to quantify natural hazard interrelationships which we cluster into three broad modelling approaches: stochastic, empirical, and mechanistic. We then synthesize results of our classification of quantification methods for hazard interrelationships and using two matrices illustrate this in practice for 24 different interrelations between 14 natural hazards, one for cascading hazards (temporal order in the multi-hazard event) and one for compound hazards (two or more hazards acting together). Finally, we provide examples of applications for each the three quantitative modelling approaches defined. We believe that this review will lead to a better understanding of quantification methodologies for hazard interrelations between different sub-disciplines that focus on natural hazards, thus aiding cross-disciplinary approaches for better understanding potential risk related to multi-hazard events.",https://openalex.org/W2953282286,https://openalex.org/W2953282286

Fritz,1996,,"Lacustrine fossil records provide long time series of data on limnological and climatic conditions; these data are useful for establishing natural patterns of climate variability and for generating testable hypotheses about atmospheric circulation and climate‐ecosystem linkages. Shoreline features can indicate past lake‐level fluctuations that may reflect changes in moisture balance, but often these records are discontinuous and are evidence of only extreme conditions. The organisms, geochemistry, and sedimentology of lake sediments may provide a more continuous sequence of direct and indirect lake‐climate interactions in the past. The most clearly interpretable paleolimnological records of climatic change are those that use several lines of evidence to corroborate a climatic hypothesis and are from sites near an ecotone or in regions of extreme climate. In all cases, hydrologic setting mediates a lake’s response to climate and must be considered in interpreting sedimentary sequences.",https://openalex.org/W2112790295,https://openalex.org/W2112790295
Coping and the biosocial consequences of food insecurity in the 21st century,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.22161,Craig Hadley; Deborah L. Crooks,2012,,"Abstract Food security occurs when all members of a household have reliable access to food in sufficient quantity and quality to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle. Given the important biological and social value of food for humans, food and food sufficiency have been traditional topics of study among biological anthropologists. The focus on food insecurity, however, has emerged within the past two decades and recent global events, including the food crisis of 2007/2008, have led to renewed interests in the topic of food insecurity and wellbeing. Here, we review current and novel threats to food security, current thinking on measurement and definitions, and then outline a model that links food insecurity to coping strategies and then to health outcomes. We suggest that coping strategies are typically context‐specific and can be food and nonfood based. We further suggest that coping strategies may impact health quite broadly, not just through nutritional pathways. We then review available data on the relationship between food insecurity and nutritional status, chronic diseases, infectious diseases, and mental health. Our review highlights the far reaching consequences of food insecurity for human wellbeing but also the considerable variability in its effect and our limited empirical knowledge of the pathways through which food insecurity impacts health. We conclude by offering thoughts on how biological anthropologists might contribute to growing our understanding of food insecurity and human health and wellbeing.

The Science of Mind Wandering: Empirically Navigating the Stream of Consciousness,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-010814-015331,Jonathan Smallwood; Jonathan W. Schooler,2014,,"Conscious experience is fluid; it rarely remains on one topic for an extended period without deviation. Its dynamic nature is illustrated by the experience of mind wandering, in which attention switches from a current task to unrelated thoughts and feelings. Studies exploring the phenomenology of mind wandering highlight the importance of its content and relation to meta-cognition in determining its functional outcomes. Examination of the information-processing demands of the mind-wandering state suggests that it involves perceptual decoupling to escape the constraints of the moment, its content arises from episodic and affective processes, and its regulation relies on executive control. Mind wandering also involves a complex balance of costs and benefits: Its association with various kinds of error underlines its cost, whereas its relationship to creativity and future planning suggest its potential value. Although essential to the stream of consciousness, various strategies may minimize the downsides of mind wandering while maintaining its productive aspects.",https://openalex.org/W2117194251,https://openalex.org/W2117194251

Evidence From Colombia Based on the Gradual Shift Causality Approach",https://doi.org/10.3389/fenrg.2021.739721,Abraham Ayobamiji Awosusi; Mário Nuno Mata; Zahoor Ahmed; Manuel Pacheco Coelho; Mehmet Altuntaş; José Moleiro Martins; Jéssica Nunes Martins; Stephen Taiwo Onifade,2022,,"Undoubtedly, fossil fuel energy consumption causes global warming. The question at the core is whether or not we want to quit energy consumption? The obvious answer to this question is “no.” Therefore, the necessity for innovation is curial to attain green energy and sustainable growth. This research specifically focused on Colombia, which represents the aforementioned threats to a large extent as the trajectory of economic expansion is characterized by significant CO 2 emissions in Colombia. In this regard, we examine the association between globalization, renewable energy, natural resources rent, economic growth, and CO 2 emissions from 1970 to 2017. The cointegration test confirmed a long association between the considered variables. This study employed the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares, Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares, and Autoregressive Distributed Lag estimators for the long-run analysis. The long-run empirical results uncovered growth-induced emissions in Colombia. The result illustrated that the path of development is unsustainable in Columbia. In contrast, globalization and renewable energy demonstrated a favorable contribution to environmental quality. The outcomes of the Gradual Shift Causality indicated that globalization, natural resource rent, and economic growth Granger cause CO 2 emissions. The findings highlight the need to enact well-coordinated measures to reduce environmental deterioration in Colombia. Colombia must aggressively promote the development of renewable energy and also foster a better viable environment for renewable energy investment to mitigate environmental damage caused by economic growth.",https://openalex.org/W4210390122,https://openalex.org/W4210390122
"Electricity Access in Sub-Saharan Africa: Uptake, Reliability, and Complementary Factors for Economic Impact",https://doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-1361-0,Moussa P. Blimpo; Malcolm Cosgrove-Davies,2019,,"Access to reliable electricity is a prerequisite for the economic transformation of economies in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), especially in a digital age. Yet the electricity access rate in the region is often substantially low, households and businesses with access often face unreliable service, and the cost of the service is often among the highest in the world. This situation imposes substantial constraints on economic activities, provision of public services, adoption of new technologies, and quality of life. Much of the focus on how to best provide reliable, affordable, and sustainable electricity service to all has been on mitigating supply-side constraints. However, demand-side constraints may be as important, if not more important. On the supply side, inadequate investments in maintenance result in high technical losses; most state-owned utilities operate at a loss; and power trade, which could significantly lower the cost of electricity, is underdeveloped. On the demand side, the uptake and willingness to pay are often low in many communities, and the consumption levels of those who are connected are limited. Increased uptake and consumption of electricity will encourage investment to improve service reliability and close the access gap. Electricity Access in Sub-Saharan Africa shows that the fundamental problem is poverty and lack of economic opportunities rather than power. The solution lies in understanding that the overarching reasons for the unrealized potential involve tightly intertwined technical, financial, political, and geographic factors. The ultimate goal is to enable households and businesses to gain access to electricity and afford its use, and utilities to recover their cost and make profits. The report makes the case that policy makers need to adopt a more comprehensive and long-term approach to electrification in the region—one centered on the productive use of electricity at affordable rates. Such an approach includes increased public and private investment in infrastructure, expanded access to credit for new businesses, improved access to markets, and additional skills development to translate the potential of expanded and reliable electricity access into substantial economic impact. Enhancing the economic capabilities of communities is the best way to achieve faster and more sustainable development progress while addressing the broad challenges of affordability, low consumption, and financial viability of utilities, as well as ensuring equitable provision between urban and rural areas.",https://openalex.org/W2922469213,https://openalex.org/W2922469213

Risk and Climate Change: Perceptions of Key Policy Actors in Canada,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0272-4332.2004.00534.x,Richard C. Stedman,2004,,"This article examines factors that predict perceptions of risk associated with global climate change. The research focuses on the perceptions of those associated with climate change policy making in the prairie region of Canada. The data are from an online survey ( n = 851) of those policy actors. The analysis integrates several dominant approaches to the study of risk perception: psychometric approaches that examine the effects of cognitive structure; demographic assessments that examine, for example, differences in perception based on gender or family status; and political approaches that suggest that one's position in the policy process may affect his or her perceived risk. Attitudes toward climate change are to a degree predicted by all of these factors, but only when indirect effects are observed. Sociodemographic characteristics have little direct effect on perceived risk, but do affect general beliefs that affect risk perceptions. Perceived risk is related more strongly to these general beliefs or world views than to more specific beliefs about the effects of climate change on weather patterns. Position within the policy process also contributes to our understanding of perceptions, with industry and governmental actors demonstrating similar attitudes, which contrast with environmental groups and university researchers.",https://openalex.org/W2119976381,https://openalex.org/W2119976381
The Opportunity Atlas: Mapping the Childhood Roots of Social Mobility,https://doi.org/10.3386/w25147,Raj Chetty; John N. Friedman; Nathaniel Hendren; Maggie R. Jones; Sonya R. Porter,2018,,"We construct a publicly available atlas of children's outcomes in adulthood by Census tract using anonymized longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population.For each tract, we estimate children's earnings distributions, incarceration rates, and other outcomes in adulthood by parental income, race, and gender.These estimates allow us to trace the roots of outcomes such as poverty and incarceration back to the neighborhoods in which children grew up.We find that children's outcomes vary sharply across nearby areas: for children of parents at the 25th percentile of the income distribution, the standard deviation of mean household income at age 35 is $5,000 across tracts within counties.We illustrate how these tract-level data can provide insight into how neighborhoods shape the development of human capital and support local economic policy using two applications.First, the estimates permit precise targeting of policies to improve economic opportunity by uncovering specific neighborhoods where certain subgroups of children grow up to have poor outcomes.Neighborhoods matter at a very granular level: conditional on characteristics such as poverty rates in a child's own Census tract, characteristics of tracts that are one mile away have little predictive power for a child's outcomes.Our historical estimates are informative predictors of outcomes even for children growing up today because neighborhood conditions are relatively stable over time.Second, we show that the observational estimates are highly predictive of neighborhoods' causal effects, based on a comparison to data from the Moving to Opportunity experiment and a quasi-experimental research design analyzing movers' outcomes.We then identify high-opportunity neighborhoods that are affordable to lowincome families, providing an input into the design of affordable housing policies.Our measures of children's long-term outcomes are only weakly correlated with traditional proxies for local economic success such as rates of job growth, showing that the conditions that create greater upward mobility are not necessarily the same as those that lead to productive labor markets.",https://openalex.org/W2896936987,https://openalex.org/W2896936987
Understanding Social Inequalities in Health,https://doi.org/10.1353/pbm.2003.0056,Michael Marmot,2003,,"A prominent feature of health in all industrialized countries is the social gradient in health and disease. Many observers believe that this gradient is simply a matter of poor health for the disadvantaged and good health for everyone else, but this is an inadequate analysis. The Whitehall Study documented a social gradient in mortality rates, even among people who are not poor, and this pattern has been confirmed by data from the United States and elsewhere. The social gradient in health is influenced by such factors as social position; relative versus absolute deprivation; and control and social participation.

Relationship between the Arctic Oscillation and Cold Surges over East Asia,https://doi.org/10.1175/2010jcli3529.1,Tae‐Won Park; Chang-Hoi Ho; Song Yang,2010,,"Abstract The present study reveals the changes in the characteristics of cold surges over East Asia associated with the Arctic Oscillation (AO). Based on circulation features, cold surges are grouped into two general types: wave train and blocking types. The blocking type of cold surge tends to occur during negative AO periods, that is, the AO-related polarity of the blocking type. However, the wave train type is observed during both positive and negative AO periods, although the wave train features associated with negative AO are relatively weaker. The cold surges during negative AO are stronger than those during positive AO in terms of both amplitude and duration. The cold surges during positive AO in which the extent of effect is confined to inland China passes through East Asia quickly because of weaker Siberian high and Aleutian low, leading to short duration of these cold surges. In contrast, the cold surge during negative AO, characterized by a well-organized anticyclone–cyclone couplet with high pressure over continental East Asia and low pressure over Japan, brings continuous cold air into the entire East Asian region for more than one week with long-lasting cold advection. It is also found that the tracks of the cold surges during negative AO tend to occur more frequently over Korea and Japan and less frequently over China, compared with those during positive AO. The tracks are related to a west–east dipole structure of the ratio of rain conversion to snow according to AO phase, resulting in freezing precipitation or snowfall events over inland China (Korea and Japan) are likely to occur more frequently during the positive (negative) AO periods.",https://openalex.org/W2079880447,https://openalex.org/W2079880447

Both historical and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 integrations are analyzed to evaluate the performance of the CMIP5 models and to identify possible changes in NH blocking frequency and duration in a warmer climate. Comparison with reanalysis data reveals that CMIP5 models can reproduce the NH blocking climatology reasonably well, although the frequency of Euro‐Atlantic blockings, particularly those with relatively short duration, is significantly underestimated during the cold season. In most models, overestimation of the Pacific blocking frequency is also evident for all durations throughout the year. In comparison to historical integrations, RCP 8.5 integrations show significant decreases in blocking frequency over both the North Pacific and north Atlantic regions, with a hint of increasing blocking frequency over western Russia.

Family‐centered prevention ameliorates the longitudinal association between risky family processes and epigenetic aging,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.12495,Gene H. Brody; Tianyi Yu; Edith Chen; Steven R. H. Beach; Gregory E. Miller,2015,,"Background Research has suggested that ‘risky’ family processes have unforeseen negative consequences for health later in life. The purpose of this study was to further understanding of risky family environments and development of health vulnerabilities by (a) examining the likelihood that elevated levels of parental depressive symptoms when children are age 11 forecast accelerated epigenetic aging 9 years later at age 20; (b) determining whether participation in an efficacious family‐centered prevention program focused on enhancing supportive parenting and strengthening family relationships will ameliorate this association; and (c) testing a moderation‐mediation hypothesis that prevention‐induced reductions in harsh parenting across adolescence will account for prevention effects in reducing accelerated epigenetic aging. Methods In the rural southeastern United States, parents and 11‐year‐old children from 399 families participated in the Strong African American Families ( SAAF ) program or a control condition. Parents reported their own depressive symptoms when their children were 11, and both youths and parents reported youth exposure to harsh parenting at ages 11 and 16. Blood was drawn from youths at age 20 to measure accelerated epigenetic aging using a marker derived from the DNA methylation of cells. Results Elevated parental depressive symptoms forecast accelerated epigenetic aging among youths in the control condition, but not among SAAF participants. Moderated‐mediation analyses confirmed that reductions in harsh parenting accounted for SAAF 's protective effects on epigenetic aging. Subsequent exploratory analyses indicated that accelerated epigenetic aging forecast emotional distress among young adults in the control condition but not among those who participated in SAAF . Conclusions This study is unique in using a randomized prevention trial to test hypotheses about the ways risky family processes contribute to accelerated epigenetic aging. The results suggest that developmentally appropriate family‐centered interventions designed to enhance parenting and strengthen families can buffer the biological residue of life in a risky family.",https://openalex.org/W2209048510,https://openalex.org/W2209048510

While this is a welcome trend, it necessitates geographic information systems (GIS) skills and imposes new challenges for data collection and analysis. So far, solutions to these challenges differ between studies, obstructing direct comparison of findings and hampering replication and extension of earlier work. This article presents a standardized structure for storing, manipulating, and analyzing high-resolution spatial data. PRIO-GRID is a vector grid network with a resolution of 0.5 x 0.5 decimal degrees, covering all terrestrial areas of the world. Gridded data comprise inherently apolitical entities; the grid cells are fixed in time and space, they are insensitive to political boundaries and developments, and they are completely exogenous to likely features of interest, such as civil war outbreak, ethnic settlement patterns, extreme weather events, or the spatial distribution of wealth. Moreover, unlike other disaggregated approaches, gridded data may be scaled up or down in a consistent manner by varying the resolution of the grid. The released dataset comes with cell-specific information on a large selection of political, economic, demographic, environmental, and conflict variables for all years, 1946–2008. A simple descriptive data assessment of population density and economic activity is offered to demonstrate how PRIO-GRID may be applied in quantitative social science research.",https://openalex.org/W2075708635,https://openalex.org/W2075708635

Cities in the World,https://doi.org/10.1787/d0efcbda-en,,2020,,"Over the past 40 years, global population has almost doubled.As a result, the size of rural areas, towns and especially cities has also grown rapidly.Today, cities are home to almost half of the global population and this share is projected to reach 55% by 2050.Global megatrends such as the climate emergency, demographic change and digitalisation will affect cities, towns and rural areas in different ways.This underlines the importance of designing efficient and coherent policy responses that are place-specific and cut across different policy domains.The global scale and the urgency of these challenges require achieving consensus on common solutions, on data and approaches, facilitated and supported by the work of multilateral and international organisations such as the OECD and the European Commission (EC).Both the OECD and the EC possess a long tradition of analysing and building regional, urban and rural policies.Moreover, both aim to boost growth and improve well-being in all regions, cities and rural areas through dedicated platforms for the exchange of best practices.This includes, for example, the OECD Regional Development Committee (RDPC), and the EU's cohesion policy and rural development policy.This study, Cities in the World, offers a valuable illustration of how such a collaboration can make a significant contribution to evidence-based policy and, ultimately, to better lives.Despite intense global discussions around urbanisation, a global definition of a 'city', 'urban area' and 'rural area' has been lacking, and thereby, limiting meaningful international comparisons.Cities in the World also offers a new perspective on urbanisation by analysing, for the first time, the growth of cities, towns and rural areas using the definition that the Statistical Commission of the United Nations endorsed in March 2020.Cities in the World also sheds light on the drivers and the consequences of urbanisation.It highlights, for example, the advantages and disadvantages of living in cities, compared to towns and rural areas.On the one hand, this includes better employment opportunities as well as better access to healthcare and education; on the other, it includes a higher cost of living, air pollution, congestion and crime.Focusing on the growth of metropolitan areas, the study shows that the population of the largest metropolitan areas has grown fastest, while one fifth of metropolitan areas are shrinking.It also highlights the importance of towns in connecting cities and rural areas.Managing rapid population growth, but also population decline in some metropolitan areas, calls for new, efficient policies to provide public services, transport, infrastructure and affordable housing.This study opens up new ways for future public policy.By categorising, measuring and comparing complex patterns of human settlements consistently across the world, it helps identify current and future needs to promote prosperous and inclusive cities, towns and rural areas.It also provides a new tool for policymakers to monitor and pursue the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and thus makes an active contribution to achieving economic, social, and environmental sustainable development in all areas.",https://openalex.org/W4234293529,https://openalex.org/W4234293529

McGill; M. M. Humphries,2011,,"Aim It has been qualitatively understood for a long time that climate change will have widely varying effects on human well-being in different regions of the world. The spatial complexities underlying our relationship to climate and the geographical disparities in human demographic change have, however, precluded the development of global indices of the predicted regional impacts of climate change on humans. Humans will be most negatively affected by climate change in regions where populations are strongly dependent on climate and favourable climatic conditions decline. Here we use the relationship between the distribution of human population density and climate as a basis to develop the first global index of predicted impacts of climate change on human populations. Location Global. Methods We use spatially explicit models of the present relationship between human population density and climate along with forecasted climate change to predict climate vulnerabilities over the coming decades. We then globally represent regional disparities in human population dynamics estimated with our ecological niche model and with a demographic forecast and contrast these disparities with CO2 emissions data to quantitatively evaluate the notion of moral hazard in climate change policies. Results Strongly negative impacts of climate change are predicted in Central America, central South America, the Arabian Peninsula, Southeast Asia and much of Africa. Importantly, the regions of greatest vulnerability are generally distant from the high-latitude regions where the magnitude of climate change will be greatest. Furthermore, populations contributing the most to greenhouse gas emissions on a per capita basis are unlikely to experience the worst impacts of climate change, satisfying the conditions for a moral hazard in climate change policies. Main conclusions Regionalized analysis of relationships between distribution of human population density and climate provides a novel framework for developing global indices of human vulnerability to climate change. The predicted consequences of climate change on human populations are correlated with the factors causing climate change at the regional level, providing quantitative support for many qualitative statements found in international climate change assessments.",https://openalex.org/W1630545993,https://openalex.org/W1630545993
Early Childbearing and Later Economic Well-Being,https://doi.org/10.2307/2094528,Sandra L. Hofferth; Kristin Anderson Moore,1979,,"In a study of 1268 women, aged 20-24 in 1968, who were surveyed in 1968 and reinterviewed in 1973 and 1975 as part of the National Longitudinal Surveys of the Labor Market Experience of Young Women, the economic situation of the women at age 27 was compared for those who had given birth to a child during their teen years with those who did not bear a child until after age 18. The effects on economic status of early childbearing were primarily negative and operated indirectly through intervening variables such as, decreased educational levels and higher fertility rates. For each year a birth was postponed, annual earnings at age 27 were increased by $197. Surprisingly, women who had a child at age 15 or 16 experienced fewer negative economic effects at age 27 than those who had a child at age 17 or 18; perhaps the younger girls continued to live with their parental family and remained in school while the slightly older girls left the parental family and dropped out of school. The negative economic effects at age 27 for black women who bore a child at an early age were less pronounced than for white women. Policy makers should be aware of these long-term negative economic effects of early childbirth and efforts should be made 1) to increase child care programs which enable young mothers to continue their schooling; 2) to provide family planning services to young mothers who are at greater risk of subsequently having large families; 3) to encourage young mothers to remain living with their parental family; and 4) to provide additional training and job counseling for young mothers. Tables depict 1) mean and standard deviations for 50 sociodemographic variables for women who were less than 19 at first birth and for women who were 19 or older at first birth; 2) estimated structural equations for the total sample, for whites only, for blacks only, for those 19 years or older at first birth, and for those less than 19 years of age at first birth; and 3) effect on economic well-being at age 27 of delaying birth by one year by age at first birth and by race.",https://openalex.org/W2030197448,https://openalex.org/W2030197448
THE SOCIAL EMBEDDEDNESS OF CRIME AND UNEMPLOYMENT*,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1993.tb01138.x,John Hagan,1993,,"A missing piece in the literature that links crime and unemployment is an understanding of the proximate causes of joblessness in the lives of individuals. Granovetter has demonstrated with his concept of social embeddedness that early employment contacts can enhance the prospects of getting a job and subsequent occupational mobility. The alternative implication is that youths who are embedded in criminal contexts can become isolated from the likelihood of legitimate adult employment. This has important implications for an understanding of crime and unemployment, for while much of past macro‐level research confirms that unemployment leads to crime in the aggregate, the reverse is likely true at the individual level among adolescents and young adults, especially in community settings with serious crime and unemployment problems. The implications of criminal embeddedness are explored in a well‐known set of London panel data. Understanding the process of embeddedness is important because it helps to identify points of intervention, such as peer and justice system contacts.",https://openalex.org/W2083279912,https://openalex.org/W2083279912
Temporal dynamics of biotic and abiotic drivers of litter decomposition,https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12590,Pablo García‐Palacios; E. Ashley Shaw; Diana H. Wall; Stephan Hättenschwiler,2016,,"Abstract Climate, litter quality and decomposers drive litter decomposition. However, little is known about whether their relative contribution changes at different decomposition stages. To fill this gap, we evaluated the relative importance of leaf litter polyphenols, decomposer communities and soil moisture for litter C and N loss at different stages throughout the decomposition process. Although both microbial and nematode communities regulated litter C and N loss in the early decomposition stages, soil moisture and legacy effects of initial differences in litter quality played a major role in the late stages of the process. Our results provide strong evidence for substantial shifts in how biotic and abiotic factors control litter C and N dynamics during decomposition. Taking into account such temporal dynamics will increase the predictive power of decomposition models that are currently limited by a single‐pool approach applying control variables uniformly to the entire decay process.",https://openalex.org/W2294602235,https://openalex.org/W2294602235
Economic Shocks and Conflict: Evidence from Commodity Prices,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2268061,Samuel Bazzi; Christopher Blattman,2013,,"Higher national incomes are correlated with lower political instability. We test three theories linking income to conflict using a new database of export price shocks. Price shocks have no effect on new conflicts, even large shocks in high-risk nations. Rising prices, however, lead to shorter, less intense wars. This evidence contradicts the theory that rising state revenues incentivize attempts at capture, but accords with two theories: that rising revenues improve state counter-insurgency capacity and reduce individual incentives to fight in existing conflicts. Conflict onset and continuation follow different processes.

Kercher,2000,,"Species richness describes the number of species of a given taxon in a given time and space. The energy limitation hypothesis links the species richness of consumer taxa to net primary productivity (NPP) through two relationships: NPP limits a taxon's density, and taxon density limits species richness. We study both relationships with a survey of 15 ground ant assemblages, along a productivity gradient from deserts to rain forests. Ant density (colonies m-2) was a positive, decelerating function of net aboveground productivity (NAP). A stepwise regression suggests that the efficiency with which NAP is converted to ant colonies increases with maximum summer temperature and decreases with precipitation. Ant species richness was a positive decelerating function of density at three spatial scales. This supports the energy limitation hypothesis' assumption that average population densities are higher in environments that are more productive. These two nonlinear functions (NAP-density and density-species richness) combine to create, at a variety of scales, positive, decelerating, productivity-diversity curves for a common, ecologically dominant taxon across the terrestrial productivity gradient. However, variance in the density and diversity explained by NAP decreases with scale, suggesting that energy limitation of diversity predominates at small spatial scales (<1 ha).",https://openalex.org/W2172998656,https://openalex.org/W2172998656

Securitisation and ‘Riskification’: Second-order Security and the Politics of Climate Change,https://doi.org/10.1177/0305829811419444,Olaf Corry,2011,,"Risk-security writers of various persuasions have suggested that risk is effectively the new security. They say risk works to widen securitisation whereby exceptional measures are made permanent and introduced to deal with merely potential, hypothetical and less-than-existential dangers. A transformation in the political logic of the security field of this kind is a potentially problematic and momentous change. However, this has so far not been much reflected in the primary theory of what security is, namely the Copenhagen School’s theory of securitisation. This article tries to tackle this problem by identifying the distinct logic of speech acts that turn issues into questions of risk politics suggesting a model for what rules or grammars they follow and what the political implications of them are. A separate kind of speech act – ‘riskification’ – is identified based on a re-theorisation of what distinguishes ‘risks’ from ‘threats’. It is argued that risk politics is not an instance of securitisation, but something distinct with its own advantages and dangers. Threat-based security deals with direct causes of harm, whereas risk-security is oriented towards the conditions of possibility or constitutive causes of harm a kind of ‘second-order’ security politics that promotes long-term precautionary governance. Separating securitisation and ‘riskification’ preserves the analytical precision of the Copenhagen School notion of securitisation, makes a new logic of security understandable to analysts of the security field, and helps to clarify what basic logic ‘normal’ non-securitised politics may follow. The new framework is demonstrated through a critical reading of literature that has suggested that climate change has been securitised.",https://openalex.org/W1976119410,https://openalex.org/W1976119410

Standard and multilevel causal modeling techniques affirmed that social exchange and job embeddedness translate EOR influence. A second multilevel test using lagged outcome measures further established that job embeddedness mediates long-term EOR effects over 18 months. These findings corroborate prevailing views that social exchange explains how mutual- and over-investment EORs motivate greater workforce commitment and loyalty.

Redfield revisited: 2. What regulates the oxygen content of the atmosphere?,https://doi.org/10.1029/1999gb900076,Timothy M. Lenton; Andrew Watson,2000,,"The continuous charcoal record, interpreted with the aid of the results of combustion experiments, indicates that the mixing ratio of atmospheric oxygen has varied remarkably little over the past 350 Myr. We develop a dynamic feedback model of the coupled P, N, C, and O 2 cycles and use perturbation analysis and a case study of the past 40 Myr to test various feedback mechanisms that have been proposed to stabilize atmospheric oxygen. These mechanisms involve alterations in nutrient driven productivity and the subsequent burial flux of organic carbon, which provides the main source of atmospheric oxygen. Suppression of the burial of phosphorus sorbed to iron minerals under anoxic conditions in ocean bottom waters tends to increase the ocean nutrient inventory and provide negative feedback against declining oxygen [ Holland, 1994]. However, denitrification is enhanced by anoxia, tending to reduce the nutrient inventory and amplify declining oxygen [ Lenton and Watson , this issue]. If organic phosphorus removal from the ocean is also suppressed under anoxic conditions, this improves oxygen regulation [ Van Cappellen and Ingall , 1994], as does direct enhancement of organic carbon burial due to reduced oxygen concentration in bottom waters [ Betts and Holland , 1991]. However, all of the ocean‐based feedback mechanisms cease to operate under increases in oxygen that remove anoxia from the ocean. Fire frequency is extremely sensitive to increases in oxygen above 21% of the atmosphere, readily suppressing vegetation on the land surface. This should transfer phosphorus from the land to the ocean, causing less carbon to be buried per unit of phosphorus and providing a weak negative feedback on oxygen [ Kump , 1988]. However, a new proposal that increases in oxygen suppress the biological amplification of rock weathering and hence the input of phosphorus to the Earth system provides the most effective oxygen regulation of all the mechanisms considered. A range of proxies suggests that the input of available phosphorus to the ocean may have been significantly reduced 40 Myr ago, suppressing new production and organic carbon burial in the model. With only ocean‐based feedback, the atmospheric oxygen reservoir is predicted to have shrunk from ∼26% of the atmosphere 40 Myr ago. However, when land plant mediated negative feedback on phosphorus weathering is added, oxygen is regulated within 19–21% of the atmosphere throughout the past 40 Myr, in a manner more consistent with paleorecords.",https://openalex.org/W2103585008,https://openalex.org/W2103585008
Attribution of climate variations and trends to human influences and natural variability,https://doi.org/10.1002/wcc.142,Kevin E. Trenberth,2011,,"Abstract Past attribution studies of climate change have assumed a null hypothesis of no role of human activities. The challenge, then, is to prove that there is an anthropogenic component. I argue that because global warming is “unequivocal” and ‘very likely’ caused by human activities, the reverse should now be the case. The task, then, could be to prove there is no anthropogenic component to a particular observed change in climate, although a more useful task is to determine what it is. In Bayesian statistics, this change might be thought of as adding a ‘prior’. The benefit of doubt and uncertainties about observations and models are then switched. Moreover, the science community is much too conservative on this issue and too many authors make what are called ‘Type II errors’ whereby they erroneously accept the null hypothesis. Global warming is contributing to a changing incidence of extreme weather because the environment in which all storms form has changed from human activities.

"Agricultural Production, Dietary Diversity and Climate Variability",https://doi.org/10.1080/00220388.2015.1018902,Andrew Dillon; Kevin McGee; Gbemisola Oseni,2015,,"Nonseparable household modelsoutline the interlinkage between agricultural production and household consumption, yet empirical extensions to investigate the effect of production on dietary diversity and diet composition are limited. While a significant literature has investigated the calorie-income elasticity abstracting from production, this paper provides an empirical application of the nonseparable household model linking the effect of exogenous variation in planting season production decisions via climate variability on household dietary diversity. Using degree days, rainfall and agricultural capital stocks as instruments, the effect of production on household dietary diversity at harvest is estimated. The empirical specifications estimate production effects on dietary diversity using both agricultural revenue and crop production diversity. Significant effects of both agricultural revenue and crop production diversity on dietary diversity are estimated. The dietary diversity-production elasticities imply that a 10 per cent increase in agricultural revenue or crop diversity result in a 1.8 per cent or 2.4 per cent increase in dietary diversity respectively. These results illustrate that agricultural income growth or increased crop diversity may not be sufficient to ensure improved dietary diversity. Increases in agricultural revenue do change diet composition. Estimates of the effect of agricultural income on share of calories by food groups indicate relatively large changes in diet composition. On average, a 10 per cent increase in agricultural revenue makes households 7.2 per cent more likely to consume vegetables, 3.5 per cent more likely to consume fish, and increases the share of tubers consumed by 5.2 per cent.",https://openalex.org/W2132743341,https://openalex.org/W2132743341

This study uses five different models i.e., each model have an important policy implication in the context of Pakistan. The results indicate that, on the short run, there is a significant negative relationship between economic growth & carbon emissions and economic growth & poverty while there is a positive relationship between i) economic growth & income inequality; and ii) poverty & income inequality.

Using observations from 34 eddy covariance sites in different biomes across Europe, we studied the sensitivity of gross primary productivity (GPP) to environmental drivers during the summer drought of 2018 versus the reference summer of 2016. We found a greater drought-induced decline of summer GPP in grasslands (-38%) than in forests (-10%), which coincided with reduced evapotranspiration and soil water content (SWC). As compared to the 'normal year' of 2016, GPP in different ecosystems exhibited more negative sensitivity to summer air temperature (Ta) but stronger positive sensitivity to SWC during summer drought in 2018, that is, a stronger reduction of GPP with soil moisture deficit. We found larger negative effects of Ta and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) but a lower positive effect of photosynthetic photon flux density on GPP in 2018 compared to 2016, which contributed to reduced summer GPP in 2018. Our results demonstrate that high temperature-induced increases in VPD and decreases in SWC aggravated drought impacts on GPP.

Further, by considering surface heat loss, ocean heat content and wind driven upwelling we explain for the first time the genesis of this cold ocean anomaly. We find that it is primarily due to extreme ocean heat loss driven by atmospheric circulation changes in the preceding two winters combined with the re-emergence of cold ocean water masses. Furthermore, we reveal that a similar cold Atlantic anomaly was also present prior to the most extreme European heat waves since the 1980s indicating that it is a common factor in the development of these events. For the specific case of 2015, we show that the ocean anomaly is linked to a stationary position of the Jet Stream that favours the development of high surface temperatures over Central Europe during the heat wave. Our study calls for an urgent assessment of the impact of ocean drivers on major European summer temperature extremes in order to provide better advance warning measures of these high societal impact events.",https://openalex.org/W2473336205,https://openalex.org/W2473336205
Dynamics of Large Herbivores in Deserts: Kangaroos and Caribou,https://doi.org/10.2307/3545094,Graeme Caughley; Anne Gunn,1993,,"The dynamics of desert plant-herbivore systems are similar whether the deserts are hot or cold, an assertion we support with information on the dynamics of red kangaroos and caribou. The essence of these systems is structural simplicity combined with high year-to-year variation in weather. We argue that such conditions simplify study of the mechanisms underlying changes in rate of increase of herbivores. Except where the herbivore is intrinsically regulated by spacing behaviour, the systems are best summarised by the functional and numerical responses of the herbivores to available forage, coupled with the growth response of the plants. A graphing of rate of increase against density provides little insight even though these systems are density-dependent in the formal sense. We show that long-term aperiodic fluctuations characteristic of such systems are, at least for kangaroos, a mathematical consequence of unpredictable short-term fluctuations in weather. Even when the weather has no time trend there will be marked trends in numbers of herbivores, either up or down, on a time scale of one or two decades. Such trends are intrinsic to the system and do not necessarily reflect special and persistent causes. Similar fluctuations of caribou numbers may be, at least in part, of similar origin.",https://openalex.org/W2033630826,https://openalex.org/W2033630826

The Social Context of Mental Illness and Violence,https://doi.org/10.2307/2137220,Virginia Aldigé Hiday,1995,,"For years a debate existed in the literature concerning whether or not mentally ill persons were more dangerous than others. Empirical work was hampered by conceptual and methodological shortcomings, and was therefore unable to settle the debate. Recently, methodologically sophisticated studies have produced evidence which indicates a modest association between active major mental disorders and violence. While some interpret this association to mean that mental illness or particular symptoms directly cause unwarranted physical aggression, this paper examines the case for the social context establishing socializing and environmental conditions which are causal in both violence and the development of mental disorder. It reviews the literature, indicating lacunae in our knowledge base, and posits a causal model which links social stratification with both mental illness and violence through the structured types of strains, events, situations and persons an individual experiences as an integral part of life.",https://openalex.org/W2107553820,https://openalex.org/W2107553820

Renehan,2016,,"There is a common perception that excess adiposity, commonly approximated by body mass index (BMI), is associated with reduced cancer survival. A number of studies have emerged challenging this by demonstrating that overweight and early obese states are associated with improved survival. This finding is termed the ""obesity paradox"" and is well recognized in the cardio-metabolic literature but less so in oncology. Here, we summarize the epidemiological findings related to the obesity paradox in cancer. Our review highlights that many observations of the obesity paradox in cancer reflect methodological mechanisms including the crudeness of BMI as an obesity measure, confounding, detection bias, reverse causality, and a specific form of the selection bias, known as collider bias. It is imperative for the oncologist to interpret the observation of the obesity paradox against the above methodological framework and avoid the misinterpretation that being obese might be ""good"" or ""protective"" for cancer patients.",https://openalex.org/W2482556255,https://openalex.org/W2482556255

Myneni,2004,,"Abstract The authors use the notion of Granger causality to investigate the relationship between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) over the Northern Hemisphere. The Granger causality analysis ensures that any apparent oceanic influence upon the atmosphere (as measured by the NAO) is provided by the ocean and is not related to preexisting conditions within the NAO itself (and vice versa when looking at the atmospheric influence upon the ocean). Although this statistical technique does not imply physical forcing of one field on the other, it is generally more reliable compared to the simple lead/lagged correlation. Using this technique, the authors find that on seasonal time scales, the preceding NAO anomalies' influence on the wintertime SST field is rather restricted. Conversely, preceding SST anomalies have a statistically significant causal effect on the wintertime NAO. However, the causal relation between preceding SSTs and the wintertime NAO is limited to the Gulf Stream extension; in contrast to the canonical tripole SST pattern typically associated with the NAO, the authors do not find that SST anomalies in either the Greenland or subtropical regions have a significant causal effect on the NAO. These results suggest that the Gulf Stream SSTs have an important influence in initiating disturbances of the atmospheric circulation over the wintertime North Atlantic.",https://openalex.org/W2088896295,https://openalex.org/W2088896295
Interracial Contact and Black Racial Attitudes: The Contact Hypothesis and Selectivity Bias,https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/74.1.205,Daniel A. Powers; Christopher G. Ellison,1995,,"One of the most serious criticisms of research on the contact hypothesis is the contention that selection bias operates to promote interaction between whites and blacks who are already relatively unprejudiced toward one another. Accordingly, attempts to infer the effect of interracial contact on racial attitudes must recognize and correct for this potential source of bias. Endogenous switching regression models are used to estimate the effect of close interracial friendship on selected racial attitude variables while accounting for possible selectivity bias. Each model implies a distinct assumption about the process generating interracial contact and racial attitudes. Using data from the National Survey of Black Americans, we find no evidence of sample selection bias in estimating the effect of close interracial contact on black racial attitudes. Therefore, we cannot reject the conventional models used in research on the contact hypothesis that treat interracial contact as an exogenous variable affecting racial attitudes. However, our results show the usefulness of a switching regressions approach to reveal the contingent nature of the contact hypothesis.",https://openalex.org/W2029712675,https://openalex.org/W2029712675

The Decrease in Summer Surface Water Temperature with Altitude in Swiss Alpine Lakes: A Comparison with Air Temperature Lapse Rates,https://doi.org/10.2307/1552583,David M. Livingstone; André F. Lotter; Ian R. Walker,1999,,"Using miniature thermistors with integrated data loggers, the decrease in summer lake surface water temperature (LSWT) with increasing altitude a.s.l. was investigated in 10 Swiss Alpine lakes located between 613 m a.s.l. and 2339 m a.s.l. The LSWTs exhibit essentially the same short-term structure as regional air temperature, but are about 3 to 5°C higher than the air temperature at the altitude of the lake. LSWTs decrease approximately linearly with increasing altitude at a rate slightly greater than the surface air temperature lapse rate. Diel variations in LSWT are large, implying that single water temperature measurements are unlikely to be representative of the mean. Local factors will affect LSWT more than they affect air temperature, possibly resulting in severe distortion of the empirical relationship between the two. Several implications for paleoclimate reconstruction studies result. (1) Paleolimnologically reconstructed LSWTs are likely to be higher than the air temperatures prevailing at the altitude of the lake. (2) Lakes used for paleoclimate reconstruction should be selected to minimize local effects on LSWT. (3) The calibration of organism-specific quantitative paleotemperature inference models should not be based on single water temperature measurements. (4) Consideration should be given to calibrating such models directly against air temperature rather than water temperature.

Using precisely dated duration data in event history models and geographic data for the conflict location, we find that conflicts located at considerable distance from the main government stronghold, along remote international borders and in regions with valuable minerals last substantially longer. In addition, we find that rebel military capacity in its own right increases the prospects of a civil conflict ending within a short time period.

Health behaviour in schoolchildren A WHO cross-national survey,https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/1.1.17,Leif Edvard Aarø; Bente Wold; Lasse Kannas; Matti Rimpelä,1986,,"""Health Behaviour in Schoolchildren. A WHO Cross-National Survey"" was started by researchers from three European countries. Presently, more than 10 countries within the European region of WHO are accepted as members of the project. The study is oriented towards behavioural and social science, and its basic philosophy is described as a lifestyle approach. In the first part of this article, differences between traditional epidemiological research and lifestyle research are outlined. The concept ""lifestyle"" is clarified, and the focuses of lifestyle, health promotion and health education research are described. It is argued that aspects of lifestyle not considered to be directly related to mortality or morbidity may be more important for an understanding of lifestyle of individuals or groups than aspects more directly related to health. Health-related habits, lifestyle and psychosocial aspects of health are chosen as criterion variables of the study. The personal and environmental context of lifestyle are the main factors on the predictor side, and the findings should also be discussed in a demographic and macrosocial context. National cross-sectional surveys (n at least 3000) are carried out regularly in an increasing number of countries. Data are collected anonymously at school, covering three age groups (mean age 11.5, 13.5, and 15.5 years). One part of the questionnaire consists of a core of questions and is repeated in every survey. The other part has a special focus which changes from survey to survey. Comparability of data across countries is given high priority. Results from the first survey (1983–84) are presented to illustrate the relative importance of country, indicators of inequality, social network, and beliefs in the harmful effects of smoking as predictors of smoking habits. The results confirm that a wide range of predictors are important. In line with the philosophy of the project, the focus of the second survey (1985–86) is on physical activity (as a positive health habit) and psychosocial aspects of health. Finally the report mentions some of the more practical and administrative problems related to this kind of cross-national research, and describes some of the limitations of large-scale cross-national surveys.",https://openalex.org/W2063019951,https://openalex.org/W2063019951
"Southern Hemisphere Synoptic Behavior in Extreme Phases of SAM, ENSO, Sea Ice Extent, and Southern Australia Rainfall",https://doi.org/10.1175/2008jcli2128.1,Alexandre Bernardes Pezza; Tom Durrant; Ian Simmonds; A. Ian Smith,2008,,"Abstract The association between Southern Hemisphere cyclones and anticyclones and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), southern annular mode (SAM), Antarctic sea ice extent (SIE), and rainfall in Perth and Melbourne is explored. Those cities are, respectively, located in the southwestern and southeastern corners of Australia, where substantial decreasing rainfall trends have been observed over the last decades. The need for a more unified understanding of large-scale anomalies in storm indicators associated with the climate features itemized above has motivated this study. The main aim is to identify cyclone-anomalous areas that are potentially important in characterizing continental rainfall anomalies from a hemispheric perspective, focusing on midlatitude Australia. The study covers the “satellite era” from 1979 to 2003 and was conducted for the southern winter when midlatitude rainfall is predominantly baroclinic. The results indicate a well-organized hemispheric cyclone pattern associated with ENSO, SAM, SIE, and rainfall anomalies. There is a moderate large-scale, high-latitude resemblance between La Niña, negative SAM, and reduced SIE in some sectors. In particular, there is a suggestion that SIE anomalies over the Indian Ocean and Western Australia sectors are associated with a large-scale pattern of cyclone/anticyclone anomalies that is more pronounced over the longitudes of Australia and New Zealand. Spatial correlation analysis suggests a robust link between cyclone density over the sectors mentioned above and rainfall in Perth and Melbourne. Statistical analyses of rainfall and SIE show modest correlations for Perth and weak correlations for Melbourne, generally corroborating the above. It is proposed that SAM and SIE are part of a complex physical system that is best understood as a coupled mechanism, and that their impacts on the circulation can be seen as partially independent of ENSO. While SAM and SIE have greater influence on the circulation affecting rainfall in the western side of Australia, ENSO is the dominant influence on the eastern half of the country. A contraction of the sea ice seems to be accompanied by a southward shift of high-latitude cyclones, which is also hypothesized to increase downstream cyclone density at midlatitudes via conservation of mass, similarly to what is observed during the extreme positive phase of the SAM. These associations build on previous developments in the literature. They bring a more unified view on high-latitude climate features, and may also help to explain the declining trends in Australian rainfall.",https://openalex.org/W1994800756,https://openalex.org/W1994800756

Smith,2014,,"While both academics and politicians have long acknowledged the connection between food price shocks and so-called ‘food riots’, this article asks whether rising domestic consumer food prices are a contributing cause of sociopolitical unrest, more broadly defined, in urban areas of Africa. In order to unravel the complex and circular relationship between rising food prices and unrest, an instrumental approach with country fixed effects is used to isolate causality at the country-month unit of analysis for the period 1990 through 2012. Two instrumental variables, changes in international grain commodity prices and local rainfall scarcity, are evaluated and used individually and jointly as instruments for changes in domestic food prices. The main finding is that a sudden increase in domestic food prices in a given month significantly increases the probability of urban unrest, especially spontaneous events and riots, in that month. Undeniably, more fundamental economic and political grievances are also drivers of such events and are likely to determine how the unrest ultimately manifests, even when triggered by rising food prices. Although more research is necessary to determine why people choose particular protest methods and targets, the findings of this research provide evidence that sociopolitical unrest of different types is driven, or at least triggered, by a consumer response to economic pressure from increasing food prices regardless of the cause of the increase.",https://openalex.org/W2028351337,https://openalex.org/W2028351337

Confirming results obtained in laboratory studies, more family disturbances were recorded when ozone levels were high than when they were low. Two-stage regression analyses indicated that disturbances and assaults against persons were also positively correlated with daily temperatures and negatively correlated with wind speed and levels of humidity. Further, distributed lag (Box-Jenkins) analyses indicated that high temperatures and low winds preceded violent episodes, which occurred more often on dry than humid days. In addition to hypothesized relations, it was also found that assaults follow complaints about family disturbances, which suggests that the latter could be used to predict and lessen physical violence. It was concluded that atmospheric conditions and violent episodes are not only correlated but also appear to be linked in a causal fashion.

Parsons,2004,,"Maps of fuels and fire regimes are essential for understanding ecological relationships between wildland fire and landscape structure, composition, and function, and for managing wildland fire hazard and risk with an ecosystem perspective. While critical for successful wildland fire management, there are no standard methods for creating these maps, and spatial data representing these important characteristics of wildland fire are lacking in many areas. We present an integrated approach for mapping fuels and fire regimes using extensive field sampling, remote sensing, ecosystem simulation, and biophysical gradient modeling to create predictive landscape maps of fuels and fire regimes. A main objective was to develop a standardized, repeatable system for creating these maps using spatial data describing important landscape gradients along with straightforward statistical methods. We developed a hierarchical approach to stratifying field sampling to ensure that samples represented variability in a wide variety of ecosystem processes. We used existing and derived spatial layers to develop a modeling database within a Geographic Information System that included 38 mapped variables describing gradients of physiography, spectral characteristics, weather, and biogeochemical cycles for a 5830-km2 study area in northwestern Montana. Using general linear models, discriminant analysis, classification and regression trees, and logistic regression, we created maps of fuel load, fuel model, fire interval, and fire severity based on spatial predictive variables and response variables measured in the field. Independently evaluated accuracies ranged from 51 to 80%. Direct gradient modeling improved map accuracy significantly compared to maps based solely on indirect gradients. By focusing efforts on direct as opposed to indirect gradient modeling, our approach is easily adaptable to mapping potential future conditions under a range of possible management actions or climate scenarios. Our methods are an example of a standard yet flexible approach for mapping fuels and fire regimes over broad areas and at multiple scales. The resulting maps provide fine-grained, broad-scale information to spatially assess both ecosystem integrity and the hazards and risks of wildland fire when making decisions about how best to restore forests of the western United States to within historical ranges and variability.",https://openalex.org/W2033130094,https://openalex.org/W2033130094

It is verified with autoregressive models and applied to a real financial analysis problem.

This paper examines the effect of weather conditions around the time of birth on the health, education, and socioeconomic outcomes of Indonesian adults born between 1953 and 1974. We link historical rainfall for each individual's birth year and birth location with current adult outcomes from the 2000 wave of the Indonesia Family Life Survey. Higher early-life rainfall has large positive effects on the adult outcomes of women, but not of men. Women with 20% higher rainfall in their year and location of birth attain 0.14 centimeters greater height, finish 0.15 more years of schooling, live in households with 5.2% higher expenditures per capita, and have spouses with 5.1% higher earnings. These patterns most plausibly reflect a positive impact of rainfall on agricultural output, leading to higher household incomes and better health for infant girls. We present suggestive evidence that eventual benefits for adult women's socioeconomic status are mediated by improved schooling attainment, which leads to higher spousal quality, which in turn improves socioeconomic status.

To answer this question, we use individual-level census data and create historical pollution patterns derived from the locations of 5,000 industrial chimneys and an atmospheric model. We show that this observation results from path-dependent neighborhood sorting that began during the Industrial Revolution, as prevailing winds blew pollution eastward. Past pollution explains up to 20% of observed neighborhood segregation in 2011, even though coal pollution stopped in the 1970s. We develop a quantitative model to identify the role of neighborhood effects and relocation rigidities underlying this persistence.",https://openalex.org/W3124281772,https://openalex.org/W3124281772
"Relations between corporate economic performance, environmental disclosure and greenhouse gas emissions: New insights",https://doi.org/10.1002/bse.2040,Omaima A. G. Hassan; Peter Romilly,2018,,"Abstract This study examines the associations and causations between corporate economic performance, environmental disclosure and greenhouse gas emissions, utilizing a large, longitudinal, multicountry dataset disaggregated between developed and developing countries. The methodology uses a simultaneous equation model with system estimation to deal with endogeneity between the variables, and Granger causality tests to indicate their direction of causation. A robust result is that lower emissions are strongly associated with better economic performance. After pretesting for stationarity, we find evidence of a one‐way causation from emissions and environmental disclosure to economic performance, but no evidence of reverse causation. We also find strong evidence of a one‐way causation from emissions to disclosure, but no evidence of reverse causation. The overarching policy implication is that environmental performance, as measured by greenhouse gas emissions, plays a crucial role in the formulation of business strategy at the firm level and government environmental policy at national and international levels.",https://openalex.org/W2776887966,https://openalex.org/W2776887966

Here we show that sixteen models contributing to the Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project simulate a weakening of mid-latitude westerlies in response to projected Arctic sea ice loss. We develop an emergent constraint based on eddy feedback, which is 1.2 to 3 times too weak in the models, suggesting that the real-world weakening lies towards the higher end of the model simulations. Still, the modelled response to Arctic sea ice loss is weak: the North Atlantic Oscillation response is similar in magnitude and offsets the projected response to increased greenhouse gases, but would only account for around 10% of variations in individual years. We further find that relationships between Arctic sea ice and atmospheric circulation have weakened recently in observations and are no longer inconsistent with those in models.",https://openalex.org/W4210342269,https://openalex.org/W4210342269

Trends and sensitivities of low streamflow extremes to discharge timing and magnitude in Pacific Northwest mountain streams,https://doi.org/10.1002/2015wr018125,Patrick R. Kormos; Charles H. Luce; Seth J. Wenger; Wouter Berghuijs,2016,,"Abstract Path analyses of historical streamflow data from the Pacific Northwest indicate that the precipitation amount has been the dominant control on the magnitude of low streamflow extremes compared to the air temperature‐affected timing of snowmelt runoff. The relative sensitivities of low streamflow to precipitation and temperature changes have important implications for adaptation planning because global circulation models produce relatively robust estimates of air temperature changes but have large uncertainties in projected precipitation amounts in the Pacific Northwest U.S. Quantile regression analyses indicate that low streamflow extremes from the majority of catchments in this study have declined from 1948 to 2013, which may significantly affect terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and water resource management. Trends in the 25th percentile of mean annual streamflow have declined and the center of timing has occurred earlier. We quantify the relative influences of total precipitation and air temperature on the annual low streamflow extremes from 42 stream gauges using mean annual streamflow as a proxy for precipitation amount effects and streamflow center of timing as a proxy for temperature effects on low flow metrics, including 7q10 summer (the minimum 7 day flow during summer with a 10 year return period), mean August , mean September , mean summer , 7q10 winter , and mean winter flow metrics. These methods have the benefit of using only readily available streamflow data, which makes our results robust against systematic errors in high elevation distributed precipitation data. Winter low flow metrics are weakly tied to both mean annual streamflow and center of timing .",https://openalex.org/W2288647533,https://openalex.org/W2288647533

The different datasets and model simulations all show a similar negative-dominant S–P correlation pattern with wet areas having more significantly negative correlations than the dry areas. The experiments with CAM3 show that this correlation pattern is not caused by the soil moisture feedback. Rather, the combined effect of the precipitation variability and the memory of soil moisture is the main reason for this correlation pattern. Theoretical analysis confirms this conclusion and shows that the correlation pattern is related to both the precipitation spectrum and the time scale of soil moisture retention. This study suggests that the attribution of lagged correlations of precipitation with soil moisture or related variables should be done cautiously.",https://openalex.org/W2020848576,https://openalex.org/W2020848576

I propose a simple model whereby children's behaviour problems, parental stress, and parenting behaviour are related. Evidence is found for a central part of this model (that child behaviour problems lead to parental stress), but other aspects are as yet untested in the developmental disability field. Future refinement of the model is discussed, with an emphasis on the role of parental appraisal processes in understanding the mechanisms by which child behaviour problems affect parental well being.

It is generally believed that increasing the consumption of renewable energy is an effective measure to promote CO2 emissions reduction. Therefore, renewable energy consumption has become one of the best alternative strategies for sustainable development. Based on this, this paper employs the 3SLS model to conduct an empirical study on the relations among real output, renewable energy consumption, and CO2 emissions of BRICS countries (except Russia) in 1999–2014. The empirical results support, for BRICS group, the complete tri-variate relationships (energy-output-emission nexus), and renewable energy had a significant positive impact on the real output, and vice versa. Besides, compared with other countries, Brazil also has the same tri-variate relationships as BRICS group. However, China has no relationship from real output to renewable energy consumption and from real output to CO2 emissions; India does not have the relationship from real output to renewable energy consumption and the bilateral relationship between real output and CO2 emissions; the relationship between variables in South Africa only occurs in the energy output chain. Finally, according to the estimation results of the simultaneous equation, the BRICs governments should consider the importance of human capital level and financial development when controlling the real output level and pollution. In addition, it should be noted that effective energy policies help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions without compromising real output.",https://openalex.org/W3007856992,https://openalex.org/W3007856992

Results reveal a unidirectional causality running from CO2 emissions to economic growth without feedback; a bidirectional causality between economic growth and energy use; a bidirectional causality between international tourism and economic growth; and a bidirectional causality between international tourism and energy use.

Causal analysis in control–impact ecological studies with observational data,https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210x.13190,Ashley E. Larsen; Kyle C. Meng; Bruce E. Kendall,2019,,"Abstract Randomized experiments have long been the gold standard in determining causal effects in ecological control–impact studies. However, it may be difficult to address many ecologically and policy‐relevant control–impact questions‐such as the effect of forest fragmentation or protected areas on biodiversity through experimental manipulation due to scale, costs and ethical considerations. Yet, ecologists may still draw causal insights in observational control–impact settings by exploiting research designs that approximate the experimental ideal. Here, we review the challenges of making causal inference in non‐experimental control–impact scenarios as well as a suite of statistical tools specifically designed to overcome such challenges. These tools are widely used in fields where experimental research is more limited (i.e., medicine, economics), and could be applied by ecologists across numerous sub‐disciplines. Using hypothetical examples, we discuss why bias is likely to plague observational control–impact studies in ways that do not surface with experimental manipulations, why bias is generally the barrier to causal inference, and different methods to overcome this bias. Satellite‐, survey‐ and citizen–science data hold great potential for advancing key questions in ecology that would otherwise be prohibitive to pursue experimentally. However, to harness such data to understand causal impacts of land, environmental and policy changes, we must expand our toolset such that we can improve inference and more confidently advance ecological understanding and science‐informed policy.",https://openalex.org/W2937513106,https://openalex.org/W2937513106

Stewart,1996,,"Abstract As Hammond has argued, traditional explanations for disagreement among experts (incompetence, venality, and ideology) are inadequate. The character and fallibilities of the human judgement process itself lead to persistent disagreements even among competent, honest, and disinterested experts. Social Judgement Theory provides powerful methods for analysing such judgementally based disagreements when the experts' judgement processes can be represented by additive models involving the same cues. However, the validity and usefulness of such representations depend on several conditions: (a) experts must agree on a problem definition, (b) experts must have access to the same information, and (c) experts must use the same organising principles. When these conditions are not met, methods for diagnosing and treating disagreement are poorly understood.

Gene-Environment Interactions in Schizophrenia: Review of Epidemiological Findings and Future Directions,https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbn117,Jim van Os; Bart P. F. Rutten; Richie Poulton,2008,,"Concern is building about high rates of schizophrenia in large cities, and among immigrants, cannabis users, and traumatized individuals, some of which likely reflects the causal influence of environmental exposures. This, in combination with very slow progress in the area of molecular genetics, has generated interest in more complicated models of schizophrenia etiology that explicitly posit gene-environment interactions (EU-GEI. European Network of Schizophrenia Networks for the Study of Gene Environment Interactions. Schizophrenia aetiology: do gene-environment interactions hold the key? [published online ahead of print April 25, 2008] Schizophr Res; S0920-9964(08) 00170–9). Although findings of epidemiological gene-environment interaction (G × E) studies are suggestive of widespread gene-environment interactions in the etiology of schizophrenia, numerous challenges remain. For example, attempts to identify gene-environment interactions cannot be equated with molecular genetic studies with a few putative environmental variables ""thrown in"": G × E is a multidisciplinary exercise involving epidemiology, psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, neuroimaging, pharmacology, biostatistics, and genetics. Epidemiological G × E studies using indirect measures of genetic risk in genetically sensitive designs have the advantage that they are able to model the net, albeit nonspecific, genetic load. In studies using direct molecular measures of genetic variation, a hypothesis-driven approach postulating synergistic effects between genes and environment impacting on a final common pathway, such as ""sensitization"" of mesolimbic dopamine neurotransmission, while simplistic, may provide initial focus and protection against the numerous false-positive and false-negative results that these investigations engender. Experimental ecogenetic approaches with randomized assignment may help to overcome some of the limitations of observational studies and allow for the additional elucidation of underlying mechanisms using a combination of functional enviromics and functional genomics.",https://openalex.org/W2117633779,https://openalex.org/W2117633779
Can Barents Sea Ice Decline in Spring Enhance Summer Hot Drought Events over Northeastern China?,https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-17-0429.1,Huixin Li; Huopo Chen; Huijun Wang; Jianqi Sun; Jiehua Ma,2018,,"In July–August (JA) of 2016, northeastern China (NEC) suffered from the most severe hot drought event of the past 50 years, leading to profound impacts on agriculture, the ecosystem, and society. Results indicate that the loss of sea ice over the Barents Sea (SICBS) in March might have influenced the hot drought events over NEC in JA for the period of 1997–2016. Further analyses reveal that lower SICBS is closely related to thinner snow depth over western Eurasia (SDWEA) in April. The decline of SDWEA leads to drier soil from the Yangtze River valley to northern China during May–June, which is favorable for precipitation deficiency over NEC in JA. Besides, the loss of SICBS in March and decline of SDWEA in April are closely related to the polar–Eurasia teleconnection pattern and dry soil over NEC in JA, which provides favorable atmospheric circulation patterns for occurrences of hot droughts.

The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing method is utilized to assess long-run cointegration. The outcome of the ARDL bounds test confirmed cointegration among the series. Furthermore, the ARDL reveals that economic growth, energy consumption and globalization trigger environmental degradation while technological innovation improves the quality of the environment. In addition, the study employed the frequency domain causality test to capture causal linkage among the series. The major advantage of this approach is that causal linkage between series can be captured at the short, medium and long term, respectively. The outcomes of the causality test revealed that globalization, technological innovation, economic growth and energy use can predict CO2 emissions in South Korea.",https://openalex.org/W3181322314,https://openalex.org/W3181322314

Bidirectional Dynamics of Materialism and Loneliness: Not Just a Vicious Cycle,https://doi.org/10.1086/671564,Rik Pieters,2013,,"This research is the first to test the hypothesis that consumers face a “material trap” in which materialism fosters social isolation which in turn reinforces materialism. It provides evidence that materialism and loneliness are engaged in bidirectional relationships over time. Importantly, it finds that loneliness contributes more to materialism than the other way around. Moreover, it finds that materialism's contribution to loneliness is not uniformly vicious but critically differs between specific subtypes of materialism. That is, valuing possessions as a happiness medicine or as a success measure increased loneliness, and these subtypes also increased most due to loneliness. Yet seeking possessions for material mirth decreased loneliness and was unaffected by it. These findings are based on longitudinal data from over 2,500 consumers across 6 years and a new latent growth model. They reveal how materialism and loneliness form a self-perpetuating vicious and virtuous cycle depending on the materialism subtype.",https://openalex.org/W2115026252,https://openalex.org/W2115026252

Lau,2008,,"Abstract The South Asian haze builds up from December to May, is mostly of anthropogenic origin, and absorbs part of the solar radiation. The influence of interannual variations of absorbing aerosols over the Indo-Gangetic Plain in May on the Indian summer monsoon is characterized by means of an observational analysis. Insight into how the aerosol impact is generated is also provided. It is shown that anomalous aerosol loading in late spring leads to remarkable and large-scale variations in the monsoon evolution. Excessive aerosols in May lead to reduced cloud amount and precipitation, increased surface shortwave radiation, and land surface warming. The June (and July) monsoon anomaly associated with excessive May aerosols is of opposite sign over much of the subcontinent (although with a different pattern) with respect to May. The monsoon strengthens in June (and July). The analysis suggests that the significant large-scale aerosol influence on monsoon circulation and hydroclimate is mediated by the heating of the land surface, pursuant to reduced cloudiness and precipitation in May. The finding of the significant role of the land surface in the realization of the aerosol impact is somewhat novel.",https://openalex.org/W2167320030,https://openalex.org/W2167320030

The empirical analysis of data collected in Hong Kong is used to elaborate and support two main claims. The first is that geography matters to not only overall well-being but also momentary well-being and that researchers should be careful to specify the influence of geographical context correctly. We therefore employ an approach that is informed by various strands of time–geographical thought and find that life satisfaction is associated more strongly with geographical context than is momentary well-being. Second, we confirm positive relations between social contacts and experienced well-being but extend earlier research by showing that these relations stretch across multiple timescales and depend to some extent on the duration of an activity episode and with whom the activity episode is undertaken. This means that the use of simple indicators of social capital is inadequate for making the complex linkages between well-being and people's social contacts understandable in empirical research.",https://openalex.org/W1977399607,https://openalex.org/W1977399607

AI has the potential to drive us towards a future in which all of humanity flourishes. It also comes with substantial risks for oppression and calamity. Discussions about whether we should (re)trust AI have repeatedly emerged in recent years and in many quarters, including industry, academia, healthcare, services, and so on. Technologists and AI researchers have a responsibility to develop trustworthy AI systems. They have responded with great effort to design more responsible AI algorithms. However, existing technical solutions are narrow in scope and have been primarily directed towards algorithms for scoring or classification tasks, with an emphasis on fairness and unwanted bias. To build long-lasting trust between AI and human beings, we argue that the key is to think beyond algorithmic fairness and connect major aspects of AI that potentially cause AI’s indifferent behavior. In this survey, we provide a systematic framework of Socially Responsible AI Algorithms that aims to examine the subjects of AI indifference and the need for socially responsible AI algorithms, define the objectives, and introduce the means by which we may achieve these objectives.

Willett,2008,,This article exploits highly detailed data on teacher absences from a large urban school district in the northern United States to shed light on the determinants and effects of teacher absences. The topic is important because both school and district policies can influence teachers’ propensity to be absent. The authors estimate the impact of teacher absences on academic achievement of students matched to elementary school teachers. Models include fixed effects for teachers to control statistically for potential correlation between time-invariant levels of teachers’ skill and effort and their rates of absence. The authors estimate 10 additional days of teacher absence reduce mathematics achievement of fourth-grade students by 3.2% of a standard deviation. They employ an additional instrumental variables strategy to bolster the case for a causal interpretation of results. Instrumental variables results indicate the impact of unexpected teacher absences on student achievement is larger than the impact of anticipated absences.,https://openalex.org/W2110147342,https://openalex.org/W2110147342

In 2016, the residential energy consumption amounted to 25.71% of the EU’s final energy consumption, representing the second largest consuming sector after transport. Consumption-related data are discussed together with data on some main energy efficiency policies and energy consumption determinants, such as economic and population growth, weather conditions, and household and building characteristics. Indicators are identified to show the impact of specific determinants on energy consumption and a new indicator is proposed, drawing a closer link between energy trends and policy and technological changes in the sector. The analysis of these determinants highlights the complex dynamics behind the demand of energy in the residential sector. Decomposition analysis is carried out using the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index technique to provide a more complete picture of the impact of various determinants (population, wealth, intensity, and weather) on the latest EU-28 residential energy consumption trends.

Bringing physical reasoning into statistical practice in climate-change science,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-021-03226-6,Theodore G. Shepherd,2021,,"Abstract The treatment of uncertainty in climate-change science is dominated by the far-reaching influence of the ‘frequentist’ tradition in statistics, which interprets uncertainty in terms of sampling statistics and emphasizes p -values and statistical significance. This is the normative standard in the journals where most climate-change science is published. Yet a sampling distribution is not always meaningful (there is only one planet Earth). Moreover, scientific statements about climate change are hypotheses, and the frequentist tradition has no way of expressing the uncertainty of a hypothesis. As a result, in climate-change science, there is generally a disconnect between physical reasoning and statistical practice. This paper explores how the frequentist statistical methods used in climate-change science can be embedded within the more general framework of probability theory, which is based on very simple logical principles. In this way, the physical reasoning represented in scientific hypotheses, which underpins climate-change science, can be brought into statistical practice in a transparent and logically rigorous way. The principles are illustrated through three examples of controversial scientific topics: the alleged global warming hiatus, Arctic-midlatitude linkages, and extreme event attribution. These examples show how the principles can be applied, in order to develop better scientific practice. “La théorie des probabilités n’est que le bon sens reduit au calcul.” (Pierre-Simon Laplace, Essai Philosophiques sur les Probabilités , 1819). “It is sometimes considered a paradox that the answer depends not only on the observations but on the question; it should be a platitude.” (Harold Jeffreys, Theory of Probability , 1st edition, 1939).",https://openalex.org/W3202323101,https://openalex.org/W3202323101

It goes on to discuss the shape of the relationship between income and health which this implies within nations. After reproducing evidence from the Health and Lifestyles Survey of a cross‐sectional relationship in Britain which is consistent with the international picture, the paper then reports on a test of the causality of that relationship. The test compared the changes between 1971 and 1981 in the position of occupations in the‘earnings league’with changes in their position in the occupational mortality league in Britain. The analysis found that changes in mortality were significantly, positively and independently related to changes in the proportion unemployed and the proportion on low relative earnings in each occupation. The percentage change in the size of each occupational group during the decade was used to control for any effects of selection in or out of occupations.

For both weekdays and weekend days, separate multinomial logistic regression models were estimated using three categories of sleep duration as the outcome category.Unmarried individuals are significantly more likely to sleep a short amount on both weekdays and weekends compared to married people. Single people also are significantly more likely to sleep a long amount. People with less than a college education are significantly more likely to sleep both a short amount and a long amount on weekdays relative to the college educated.High-risk sleep durations (short sleeping and long sleeping) are positively associated with sociodemographic categories associated with poorer health.

On the basis of three surveys (ALLBUS, 1996, N = 2893; Shell Youth Study (Deutsche Shell), 2000, N = 3560; and our own survey of school students, N = 769), the hypothesis that this difference can be largely explained by contrasting interethnic contact opportunities and experiences is tested and supported. Demographic data show that living in the Eastern or Western part of Germany offers differential opportunities for contact with foreigners. Structural equation analyses reveal that this difference, in turn, influences the number of foreigners in the neighborhood or classroom. As a consequence of these varying opportunities for contact, respondents report marked differences in more intimate and personal contact—such as having foreign friends or experiencing contact of personal importance. Foreign friends and importance of contact proved to be the relevant proximal contact variables that reduce ethnic prejudice.

Intermittency of Arctic–mid-latitude teleconnections: stratospheric pathway between autumn sea ice and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-1-261-2020,Peter Yu Feng Siew; Camille Li; Stefan Sobolowski; Martin P. King,2020,,"Abstract. There is an observed relationship linking Arctic sea ice conditions in autumn to mid-latitude weather the following winter. Of interest in this study is a hypothesized stratospheric pathway whereby reduced sea ice in the Barents and Kara seas enhances upward wave activity and wave-breaking in the stratosphere, leading to a weakening of the polar vortex and a transition of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) to its negative phase. The Causal Effect Networks (CEN) framework is used to explore the stratospheric pathway between late autumn Barents–Kara sea ice and the February NAO, focusing on its seasonal evolution, timescale dependence, and robustness. Results indicate that the pathway is statistically detectable and has been relatively active over the 39-year observational period used here, explaining approximately 26 % of the interannual variability in the February NAO. However, a bootstrap-based resampling test reveals that the pathway is highly intermittent: the full stratospheric pathway appears in only 16 % of the sample populations derived from observations, with individual causal linkages ranging from 46 % to 84 % in occurrence rates. The pathway's intermittency is consistent with the weak signal-to-noise ratio of the atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice variability in modelling experiments and suggests that Arctic–mid-latitude teleconnections might be favoured in certain background states. On shorter timescales, the CEN detects two-way interactions between Barents–Kara sea ice and the mid-latitude circulation that indicate a role for synoptic variability associated with blocking over the Urals region and moist air intrusions from the Euro-Atlantic sector. This synoptic variability has the potential to interfere with the stratospheric pathway, thereby contributing to its intermittency. This study helps quantify the robustness of causal linkages within the stratospheric pathway, and provides insight into which linkages are most subject to sampling issues within the relatively short observational record. Overall, the results should help guide the analysis and design of ensemble modelling experiments required to improve physical understanding of Arctic–mid-latitude teleconnections.",https://openalex.org/W3024157239,https://openalex.org/W3024157239

To investigate the pathways for sustainable development, this study includes innovation and green finance into simultaneous equations models within energy-environment-climate nexus. We examine the dynamic relationships for a sample of 49 countries with green bonds issued for the period 2007–2019. The results confirm that there are bidirectional relationships among renewable energy consumption, environmental pollution and climate change. Innovation can significantly promote renewable energy consumption, reduce CO 2 emissions and mitigate climate change. Green finance can effectively alleviate environmental pollution and climate change. Accelerating the development of green finance is the primary motivation for sustainable development. Green finance moderates the relationship between innovation and energy-environment-climate nexus. The positive impact of innovation on renewable energy consumption is enhanced by higher level of green finance. When the development of green finance is high, innovation has a greater negative influence on CO2 emissions, and the impact of innovation on climate change is weakened.",https://openalex.org/W4280586086,https://openalex.org/W4280586086

This focus upon justice is contrasted with the more traditional focus upon the level of outcomes received from the political system and upon congruence in citizen‐leader policy preferences. The results strongly support a focus upon justice by showing that judgments of injustice exercise an influence upon leadership evaluations and in stitutional endorsements which is independent of beliefs about the level of outcomes the political system is providing to citizens or of public support for government policies.

Sociohydrology is the study of coupled human–water systems, building on the premise that water and human systems co-evolve: the state of the water system feeds back onto the human system, and vice versa, a situation denoted as ""two-way coupling"". A recent special issue in HESS/ESD, ""Predictions under change: water, earth, and biota in the Anthropocene"", includes a number of sociohydrologic publications that allow for a survey of the current state of understanding of sociohydrology and the dynamics and feedbacks that couple water and human systems together, of the research methodologies being employed to date, and of the normative and ethical issues raised by the study of sociohydrologic systems. Although sociohydrology is concerned with coupled human–water systems, the feedback may be filtered by a connection through natural or social systems, for example, the health of a fishery or through the global food trade, and therefore it may not always be possible to treat the human–water system in isolation. As part of a larger complex system, sociohydrology can draw on tools developed in the social–ecological and complex systems literature to further our sociohydrologic knowledge, and this is identified as a ripe area of future research.",https://openalex.org/W2081993865,https://openalex.org/W2081993865

Cross-National Statistical Research and the Study of Comparative Politics,https://doi.org/10.2307/2111217,Robert W. Jackman,1985,,"It is often suggested that cross-national statistical research is excessively narrow and oversimplified, that it is plagued by unique measurement problems, and that it can have few causal implications. In light of these arguments, this paper evaluates the role of such research in the comparative study of politics. The paper begins with a comparison of the experimental, comparative, and statistical modes of empirical analysis, and then considers, in turn, issues in the development of generalizations, in the identification of variables, and in the interpretation of relations between variables. The last section of the paper addresses problems associated with making causal inferences in cross-national research. This involves a comparison of cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, a discussion of measurement validity, and a consideration of the fact that empirical research seldom offers a full, direct test of a theory. It is concluded that the comparative and statistical methods share a common logic of analysis, and that the statistical method can be a powerful tool in the comparative study of politics.",https://openalex.org/W2254191652,https://openalex.org/W2254191652
Reflections on the foundations of system dynamics,https://doi.org/10.1002/sdr.462,George P. Richardson,2011,,"Abstract Jay W. Forrester's original statement of the foundations of system dynamics emphasized four ‘threads’: computing technology, computer simulation, strategic decision making, and the role of feedback in complex systems. Subsequent work has expanded on these to expose the significance in the system dynamics approach of dynamic thinking, stock‐and‐flow thinking, operational thinking, and so on. But the foundation of systems thinking and system dynamics lies deeper than these and is often implicit or even ignored: it is the “endogenous point of view”. The paper begins with historical background, clarifies the endogenous point of view, illustrates with examples, and argues that the endogenous point of view is the sine qua non of systems approaches. What expert systems teachers and practitioners have to offer their students and the world is a set of tools, habits of thought, and skills enabling the discovery and understanding of endogenous sources of complex system behavior.

"On Good Politicians and Bad Policies: Social Cohesion, Institutions, and Growth",https://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-2448,Michael Woolcock; William Easterly; Jo Ritzen,2000,,"No AccessPolicy Research Working Papers25 Jun 2013On Good Politicians and Bad Policies: Social Cohesion, Institutions, and GrowthAuthors/Editors: Michael Woolcock, William Easterly, Jo RitzenMichael Woolcock, William Easterly, Jo Ritzenhttps://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-2448SectionsAboutPDF (0.2 MB) ToolsAdd to favoritesDownload CitationsTrack Citations ShareFacebookTwitterLinked In Abstract:September 2000 One of the primary reasons that otherwise good politicians enact bad policies in countries all over the world, but especially in low-income countries, is that they face significant constraints in their efforts to bring about reform. These constraints-the room for maneuver-are shaped by the degree of social cohesion in a country and the quality of its institutions. Social cohesion-that is, the inclusiveness of a country's communities-is essential for generating the trust needed to implement reforms. Citizens have to trust that the short-term losses that inevitably arise from reform will be more than offset by long-term gains. However, in countries divided along class and ethnic lines and with weak institutions, even the boldest, most civic-minded and well-informed politician (or interest group) will face severe constraints in bringing about policy reform. Ritzen, Easterly, and Woolcock hypothesize that key development outcomes (particularly economic growth) are more likely to be associated with countries that are both socially cohesive and governed by effective public institutions. They test this hypothesis for the sample of countries with available data. The authors develop a conceptual framework based on the idea of social cohesion, then review the evidence on which it is based. While several earlier studies have shown that differences in growth rates among developing countries are a result of weak rule of law, lack of democracy, and other institutional deficiencies, Ritzen, Easterly, and Woolcock focus on the social conditions that give rise to these deficiencies. They also seek to establish empirically a causal sequence from social divisions to weak institutions to slow growth. The essence of their argument, supported by new econometric evidence, is that pro-development policies are comparatively rare in the developing world less because of the moral fiber of politicians (though that surely matters) than because good politicians typically lack the room for maneuver needed to make desired reforms. This lack of maneuverability is a product of insufficient social cohesion and weak institutions. The authors also explore the determinants of social cohesion, focusing on historical accidents, initial conditions, and natural resource endowments. Social cohesion should not be seen as a concern primarily of developing and transition economies. Indeed, it is as important in the United Kingdom as in Ukraine, in Canada as in Colombia, in the Netherlands as in Nigeria. This paper-a joint product of the Office of the Vice President, Development Policy and Macroeconomics and Growth, Development Research Group-is part of a larger effort in the Bank to understand the role of social cohesion and institutions in development.

Food insecurity in rural Tanzania is associated with maternal anxiety and depression,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.20505,Craig Hadley; Crystal L. Patil,2006,,"Abstract Food insecurity is a major health problem that has pervasive effects on many human biological outcomes. In particular, there are compelling theoretical and empirical reasons to expect that the relationship between food insecurity may be directly related to mental health morbidities, and may be quantifiable in developing country settings. This preliminary study examined whether caretaker reports of food insecurity were associated with anxiety and depression among four ethnic groups in two communities of rural Tanzania. In‐home interviews were conducted in June–August of 2005 among female caretakers (n = 449). In addition to collecting household and demographic data, modified versions of the USDA's food security module and Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) were used to measure food insecurity and anxiety and depression. Consistent with predictions, the results showed a strong positive correlation between a caretaker's score on the food insecurity instrument and her summed response on the HSCL ( P &lt; 0.0001). This association was maintained in all four ethnic groups, even when controlling for individual‐level covariates such as caretaker's age and marital status. Issues of causality and hypotheses that might explain this robust finding are discussed, as are methodological and theoretical implications. Am. J. Hum.

Does job insecurity deteriorate health?,https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3122,Eve Caroli; Mathilde Godard,2014,,"Summary This paper estimates the causal effect of perceived job insecurity – that is, the fear of involuntary job loss – on health in a sample of men from 22 European countries. We rely on an original instrumental variable approach on the basis of the idea that workers perceive greater job security in countries where employment is strongly protected by the law and more so if employed in industries where employment protection legislation is more binding; that is, in induastries with a higher natural rate of dismissals. Using cross‐country data from the 2010 European Working Conditions Survey, we show that, when the potential endogeneity of job insecurity is not accounted for, the latter appears to deteriorate almost all health outcomes. When tackling the endogeneity issue by estimating an instrumental variable model and dealing with potential weak‐instrument issues, the health‐damaging effect of job insecurity is confirmed for a limited subgroup of health outcomes; namely, suffering from headaches or eyestrain and skin problems. As for other health variables, the impact of job insecurity appears to be insignificant at conventional levels.

Ruddell; Praveen Kumar,2020,,"Abstract The concept of causal interactions between components is an integral part of hydrology and Earth system sciences. Modelers, decision makers, scientists, and other water resources stakeholders all utilize some notion of cause‐and‐effect to understand processes, make decisions, and infer how systems react to change. However, there are different perspectives on the meaning of causality in complex systems and, further, different frameworks and methodologies with which to detect causal interactions. We propose here that information theory (IT) provides a compelling framework for the detection of causality and discuss approaches for several levels of analyses that capture interactions that range from pairwise to multivariate in nature. We illustrate these types of analyses with an example based on weather station time series variables, in which variables may interact pairwise or jointly and on short to long time scales. In general, many unsolved or even unanticipated questions in the hydrologic sciences could benefit from this perspective.",https://openalex.org/W3009145004,https://openalex.org/W3009145004
Surface temperature cooling trends and negative radiative forcing due to land use change toward greenhouse farming in southeastern Spain,https://doi.org/10.1029/2008jd009912,Pablo Campra; Mónica García; Yolanda Cantón; Alicia Palacios‐Orueta,2008,,"Greenhouse horticulture has experienced in recent decades a dramatic spatial expansion in the semiarid province of Almeria, in southeastern (SE) Spain, reaching a continuous area of 26,000 ha in 2007, the widest greenhouse area in the world. A significant surface air temperature trend of −0.3°C decade −1 in this area during the period 1983–2006 is first time reported here. This local cooling trend shows no correlation with Spanish regional and global warming trends. Radiative forcing (RF) is widely used to assess and compare the climate change mechanisms. Surface shortwave RF (SWRF) caused through clearing of pasture land for greenhouse farming development in this area is estimated here. We present the first empirical evidences to support the working hypothesis of the development of a localized forcing created by surface albedo change to explain the differences in temperature trends among stations either inside or far from this agricultural land. SWRF was estimated from satellite‐retrieved surface albedo data and calculated shortwave outgoing fluxes associated with either uses of land under typical incoming solar radiation. Outgoing fluxes were calculated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data. A difference in mean annual surface albedo of +0.09 was measured comparing greenhouses surface to a typical pasture land. Strong negative forcing associated with land use change was estimated all year round, ranging from −5.0 W m −2 to −34.8 W m −2 , with a mean annual value of −19.8 W m −2 . According to our data of SWRF and local temperatures trends, recent development of greenhouse horticulture in this area may have masked local warming signals associated to greenhouse gases increase.",https://openalex.org/W2080924030,https://openalex.org/W2080924030
Key Role of the North Pacific Oscillation–West Pacific Pattern in Generating the Extreme 2013/14 North American Winter,https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-14-00726.1,Stephen Baxter; Sumant Nigam,2015,,"Abstract The 2013/14 boreal winter (December 2013–February 2014) brought extended periods of anomalously cold weather to central and eastern North America. The authors show that a leading pattern of extratropical variability, whose sea level pressure footprint is the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) and circulation footprint the West Pacific (WP) teleconnection—together, the NPO–WP—exhibited extreme and persistent amplitude in this winter. Reconstruction of the 850-hPa temperature, 200-hPa geopotential height, and precipitation reveals that the NPO–WP was the leading contributor to the winter climate anomaly over large swaths of North America. This analysis, furthermore, indicates that NPO–WP variability explains the most variance of monthly winter temperature over central-eastern North America since, at least, 1979. Analysis of the NPO–WP related thermal advection provides physical insight on the generation of the cold temperature anomalies over North America. Although NPO–WP’s origin and development remain to be elucidated, its concurrent links to tropical SSTs are tenuous. These findings suggest that notable winter climate anomalies in the Pacific–North American sector need not originate, directly, from the tropics. More broadly, the attribution of the severe 2013/14 winter to the flexing of an extratropical variability pattern is cautionary given the propensity to implicate the tropics, following several decades of focus on El Niño–Southern Oscillation and its regional and far-field impacts.",https://openalex.org/W1805458330,https://openalex.org/W1805458330

The results suggest that there is a reciprocal relationship between protest and repression and that protest is consistent over time. Democracies were found to be most likely to accommodate the opposition and, at the same time, were least likely to display continuous repressive behavior. However, if faced with popular dissent, democracies were just as likely to respond with negative sanctions as other regime types, whereas negative sanctions were particularly unsuccessful to solicit dissident cooperation in democracies.",https://openalex.org/W2090732629,https://openalex.org/W2090732629

To account for such feedbacks, we implemented a novel plant individual-based vegetation dynamics-ecosystem biogeochemistry scheme within the RCA3 RCM. Variations in leaf area index (LAI) of seven plant functional type (PFTs) in response to physical forcing and evolving vegetation state feed back to climate via adjustments in surface energy fluxes and surface properties. In an ERA-40-driven simulation over Europe, the model reproduces the recent past climate with comparable accuracy to the standard RCM. Large-scale patterns of LAI, net primary production and vegetation composition were comparable with observations, although winter LAI was systematically overestimated compared to satellite estimates. Analysis of the ERA-40 simulation and an A1B climate-change simulation revealed considerable covariation among dynamic variables of the physical climate and vegetation. At a Mediterranean site, periodic soil water limitation led to fluctuations in leaf cover and a likely positive feedback to near-surface temperature. At an alpine site, rising temperatures led to forest advance onto tundra areas, reducing albedo and effecting a likely positive feedback on temperature. Climate—vegetation coupling was less pronounced but still apparent at intermediate temperate and boreal sites.",https://openalex.org/W2155340236,https://openalex.org/W2155340236
Crime Is in the Air: The Contemporaneous Relationship between Air Pollution and Crime,https://doi.org/10.1086/707127,Malvina Bondy; Sefi Roth; Lutz Sager,2019,,"Many empirical studies have examined the various determinants of crime. However, the link between crime and air pollution has been largely overlooked. In this paper we study whether exposure to ambient air pollution affects crime using daily administrative data for London in 2004–5. For identification, we estimate models with ward fixed effects and implement two instrumental variable strategies, using atmospheric inversions and wind direction as exogenous shocks to local pollution. We find that air pollution has a positive and statistically significant impact on overall crime and on several major crime categories, including those with economic motives. Importantly, the effect also occurs at pollution levels that are well below current regulatory standards and appears to be unevenly distributed across income groups. Our results suggest that reducing air pollution in urban areas may be an effective measure to reduce crime and that air pollution forecasts can be used to improve predictive policing.",https://openalex.org/W2904426259,https://openalex.org/W2904426259
Multi-scale meteorological conceptual analysis of observed active fire hotspot activity and smoke optical depth in the Maritime Continent,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-12-2117-2012,Jeffrey S. Reid; Peng Xian; E. J. Hyer; Maria Flatau; Ellen Ramirez; F. Joseph Turk; Charles R. Sampson; C. Zhang; Edward M. Fukada; Eric D. Maloney,2012,,"Abstract. Much research and speculation exists about the meteorological and climatological impacts of biomass burning in the Maritime Continent (MC) of Indonesia and Malaysia, particularly during El Nino events. However, the MC hosts some of the world's most complicated meteorology, and we wish to understand how tropical phenomena at a range of scales influence observed burning activity. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived active fire hotspot patterns coupled with aerosol data assimilation products, satellite based precipitation, and meteorological indices, the meteorological context of observed fire prevalence and smoke optical depth in the MC are examined. Relationships of burning and smoke transport to such meteorological and climatic factors as the interannual El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), El Nino Modoki, Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), the seasonal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, the 30–90 day Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), tropical waves, tropical cyclone activity, and diurnal convection were investigated. A conceptual model of how all of the differing meteorological scales affect fire activity is presented. Each island and its internal geography have different sensitivities to these factors which are likely relatable to precipitation patterns and land use practices. At the broadest scales as previously reported, we corroborate ENSO is indeed the largest factor. However, burning is also enhanced by periods of El Nino Modoki. Conversely, IOD influences are unclear. While interannual phenomena correlate to total seasonal burning, the MJO largely controls when visible burning occurs. High frequency phenomena which are poorly constrained in models such as diurnal convection and tropical cyclone activity also have an impact which cannot be ignored. Finally, we emphasize that these phenomena not only influence burning, but also the observability of burning, further complicating our ability to assign reasonable emissions.",https://openalex.org/W2071123370,https://openalex.org/W2071123370

Economic Decision-Making in Poverty Depletes Behavioral Control,https://doi.org/10.2202/1935-1682.2973,Dean Spears,2011,,"Abstract Economic theory and conventional wisdom suggest that time preference can cause or perpetuate poverty.

In all three studies, poverty is associated with diminished behavioral control. The primary contribution of this empirical paper is to isolate the direction of causality from poverty to behavior. Three similar possible theoretical mechanisms, found in the psychology and behavioral economics literatures, cannot be definitively separated. One supported theoretical explanation is that poverty, by making economic decision-making more difficult, depletes cognitive control.",https://openalex.org/W2147370444,https://openalex.org/W2147370444
A genetic exploration of the relationship between Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and cardiovascular diseases,https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.20.24304533,Eva Lukas; Rada R Veeneman; Dirk J. A. Smit; Jentien M. Vermeulen; Gita A. Pathak; Renato Polimanti; Karin J. H. Verweij; Jorien L. Treur,2024,,"ABSTRACT Background and Aims Experiencing a traumatic event may lead to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), including symptoms such as flashbacks and hyperarousal. Individuals suffering from PTSD are at increased risk of cardiovascu-lar disease (CVD), but it is unclear why. This study assesses shared genetic liability and potential causal pathways between PTSD and CVD. Methods We leveraged summary-level data of genome-wide association studies (PTSD: N= 1,222,882; atrial fibril-lation (AF): N=482,409; coronary artery disease (CAD): N=1,165,690; hypertension: N=458,554; heart failure (HF): N=977,323). First, we estimated genetic correlations and utilized genomic structural equation modeling to identify a common genetic factor for PTSD and CVD. Next, we assessed biological, behavioural, and psychosocial factors as potential mediators. Finally, we employed multivariable Mendelian randomiza-tion to examine causal pathways between PTSD and CVD, incorporating the same potential mediators. Results Significant genetic correlations were found between PTSD and CAD, HT, and HF ( r g =0.21-0.32, p ≤ 3.08 · 10* 16 ), but not between PTSD and AF. Insomnia, smoking, alcohol dependence, waist-to-hip ratio, and inflammation (IL6, C-reactive protein) partly mediated these associations. Mendelian randomization indicated that PTSD causally increases CAD (IVW OR=1.53, 95% CIs=1.19-1.96, p=0.001), HF (OR=1.44, CIs=1.08-1.92, p=0.012), and to a lesser degree hypertension (OR=1.25, CIs=1.05-1.49, p=0.012). While insomnia, smoking, alcohol, and inflammation were important mediators, independent causal effects also remained. Conclusions In addition to shared genetic liability between PTSD and CVD, we present strong evidence for causal effects of PTSD on CVD. Crucially, we implicate specific lifestyle and biological mediators (insomnia, substance use, inflammation) which has important implications for interventions to prevent CVD in PTSD patients. Translational perspective The significant mental and physical strain experienced by patients suffering from Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remains a domain necessitating further insight for the development of effective intervention strategies. Our study elucidates the complex genetic architecture that underlies the relationship between PTSD and cardiovascular disease. We present evidence supporting a causal link from PTSD to coronary artery disease and heart failure. Further, we identify various mediators of this causality, including inflammatory markers, substance use, waist-to-hip ratio and sleep deprivation. Our work calls for tar-geted preventive and therapeutic approaches to reduce the dual burden of mental and physical disease in PTSD patients.",https://openalex.org/W4392974697,https://openalex.org/W4392974697

It observes a specific kind of causality running from technological progress to reduction of CO2 emission in the United States during 1963–2010, while past income generation is the cause of rising carbon emission. Policy makers should emphasise R&D for updated production technology, while raising income helps to reduce CO2 emission.

A new approach to resolving climate-cryosphere relations: Downscaling climate dynamics to glacier-scale mass and energy balance without statistical scale linking,https://doi.org/10.1029/2011jd015669,Thomas Mölg; Georg Kaser,2011,,"[1] We present a novel combination of methods to quantify the local mass response of mountain glaciers to large-scale circulation. Previously, such multiscale approaches bypassed the mesoscale processes of the mountain-induced atmospheric flow, by statistical transfer functions or subgrid parameterizations, and included simplified glacier mass balance (MB) models. Here we show, on the basis of Kilimanjaro (East Africa) as a test case, that a limited area atmospheric model (LAM) and a process-resolving MB model can be linked without statistical corrections at their interface. This is evident from robust energy and MB patterns at the glacier surface, regardless of whether the MB model is forced by (1) in situ meteorological measurements or (2) uncorrected output from the high-resolution LAM grid over the glacier area. The latter is achieved by multiple grid nesting in the land-atmosphere-ocean domain of the LAM. Since this setup resolves the mesoscale process space, we also show the potential to increase knowledge of how dynamical, thermodynamic, and microphysical phenomena of the mountain-induced flow affect glacier MB. All these results are encouraging for future research because they demonstrate that a dynamical system, which operates on very different space-time scales, can be quantified in a fully physical way, if dynamic meteorology and glaciology are exploited in a complementary sense. This will enhance the process understanding of forward problems (glacier response to climate forcing) and backward problems (climate signal extraction from past extents of mountain glaciers).",https://openalex.org/W2061000793,https://openalex.org/W2061000793

Subjective well-being poverty<i>vs</i>. Income poverty and capabilities poverty?,https://doi.org/10.1080/00220380600884167,Geeta Kingdon; John Knight,2006,,"Abstract The conventional approach of economists to the measurement of poverty is to use measures of income or consumption. This has been challenged by those who favour broader criteria, such as fulfilment of 'basic needs' and the 'capabilities' to be and to do things of intrinsic worth. This paper asks: to what extent are these different concepts measurable, to what extent are they competing or complementary, and is it possible for them to be accommodated within an encompassing framework? We conclude that it is possible to view subjective well-being as an encompassing concept, which permits us to quantify the relevance and importance of the other approaches and of their component variables. Any attempt to define poverty involves a value judgment as to what constitutes a good quality of life or a bad one. We argue that an approach which examines the individual's own perception of well-being is less imperfect, or more quantifiable, or both, as a guide to forming that value judgement than are the other potential approaches. The argument is illustrated using a South African household survey.",https://openalex.org/W2134150956,https://openalex.org/W2134150956
Tropical forests and adaptation to climate change: in search of synergies,https://doi.org/10.17528/cifor/001892,Carmenza Robledo; Markku Kanninen; Lucio Pedroni; eds.,2005,,"Vulnerability to natural disasters has increased tremendously during the past 25 years and their effects disproportionately affect poor people.Natural disasters, such as storms, especially tropical cyclones, floods, droughts, forest fires, and landslides, affect the poor more severely because they are often forced to live in areas that are more susceptible to natural hazards.With few alternatives within their reach, the poor often make their living on steep hillsides, or lowlying riparian and coastal areas that are exposed to landslides, mudslides, floods and tidal waves.An increasing number of these fragile sites are facing rapid environmental degradation including erosion, reduced soil fertility, declining quality and availability of freshwater, increase in pests and diseases, and loss of biodiversity.Poor people generally do not have the savings or access to credit to mitigate these risks, and even fewer assets to rely on in such hard times.Climatic variables are increasingly considered as a determinant factor in the development process.It is now well recognised that many developing countries, particularly in the tropics, are more exposed to extreme events and that they are likely to be more vulnerable than countries in other regions.This is especial relevant for poor households living in these countries because, in general, their livelihoods count with a much lower adaptation capacity.Current changes in the climatic system tend to increase the vulnerability of livelihoods in two main ways: First, due to the fact that many of such livelihoods are exposed to more frequent and intense extreme events causing increasingly negative impacts.The second reason is related to the long-term impacts of changes in temperature and rain patterns.Some potential impacts are loss of land as a consequence of sea rise, loss of arable land due to extended drought periods, loss of food or other basic goods and in general an important reduction of the production basis of the poor.Understanding the interrelations between changes in the climatic system and development is therefore crucial for increasing adaptation capacity at the local level.This represents a challenge for scientists as for policy makers and those engaged in development cooperation.",https://openalex.org/W1542606695,https://openalex.org/W1542606695

For both samples, cross-lagged regression analyses showed that union loyalty caused greater formal participation in union activities. Separate path analyses demonstrated that perceptions of union instrumentality, extrinsic job dissatisfaction, and early socialization experiences predicted union loyalty in both samples.

A Time-Varying Causality Formalism Based on the Liang–Kleeman Information Flow for Analyzing Directed Interactions in Nonstationary Climate Systems,https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-18-0881.1,Daniel Fiifi Tawia Hagan; Guojie Wang; X. San Liang; A. J. Dolman,2019,,"Abstract The interaction between the land surface and the atmosphere is of significant importance in the climate system because it is a key driver of the exchanges of energy and water. Several important relations to heat waves, floods, and droughts exist that are based on the interaction of soil moisture and, for instance, air temperature and humidity. Our ability to separate the elements of this coupling, identify the exact locations where they are strongest, and quantify their strengths is, therefore, of paramount importance to their predictability. A recent rigorous causality formalism based on the Liang–Kleeman (LK) information flow theory has been shown, both theoretically and in real-world applications, to have the necessary asymmetry to infer the directionality and magnitude within geophysical interactions. However, the formalism assumes stationarity in time, whereas the interactions within the land surface and atmosphere are generally nonstationary; furthermore, it requires a sufficiently long time series to ensure statistical sufficiency. In this study, we remedy this difficulty by using the square root Kalman filter to estimate the causality based on the LK formalism to derive a time-varying form. Results show that the new formalism has similar properties compared to its time-invariant form. It is shown that it is also able to capture the time-varying causality structure within soil moisture–air temperature coupling. An advantage is that it does not require very long time series to make an accurate estimation. Applying a wavelet transform to the results also reveals the full range of temporal scales of the interactions.",https://openalex.org/W2966817232,https://openalex.org/W2966817232

Scaife,2019,,"Abstract The stratosphere contains ~17% of Earth’s atmospheric mass, but its existence was unknown until 1902. In the following decades our knowledge grew gradually as more observations of the stratosphere were made. In 1913 the ozone layer, which protects life from harmful ultraviolet radiation, was discovered. From ozone and water vapor observations, a first basic idea of a stratospheric general circulation was put forward. Since the 1950s our knowledge of the stratosphere and mesosphere has expanded rapidly, and the importance of this region in the climate system has become clear. With more observations, several new stratospheric phenomena have been discovered: the quasi-biennial oscillation, sudden stratospheric warmings, the Southern Hemisphere ozone hole, and surface weather impacts of stratospheric variability. None of these phenomena were anticipated by theory. Advances in theory have more often than not been prompted by unexplained phenomena seen in new stratospheric observations. From the 1960s onward, the importance of dynamical processes and the coupled stratosphere–troposphere circulation was realized. Since approximately 2000, better representations of the stratosphere—and even the mesosphere—have been included in climate and weather forecasting models. We now know that in order to produce accurate seasonal weather forecasts, and to predict long-term changes in climate and the future evolution of the ozone layer, models with a well-resolved stratosphere with realistic dynamics and chemistry are necessary.",https://openalex.org/W2980421467,https://openalex.org/W2980421467
Income Segregation between School Districts and Inequality in Students’ Achievement,https://doi.org/10.1177/0038040717741180,Ann Marie Deer Owens,2017,,"Large achievement gaps exist between high- and low-income students and between black and white students. This article explores one explanation for such gaps: income segregation between school districts, which creates inequality in the economic and social resources available in advantaged and disadvantaged students’ school contexts. Drawing on national data, I find that the income achievement gap is larger in highly segregated metropolitan areas. This is due mainly to high-income students performing better, rather than low-income children performing worse, in more-segregated places. Income segregation between districts also contributes to the racial achievement gap, largely because white students perform better in more economically segregated places. Descriptive portraits of the school districts of high- and low-income students show that income segregation creates affluent districts for high-income students while changing the contexts of low-income students negligibly. Considering income and race jointly, I find that only high-income white families live in the affluent districts created by income segregation; black families with identically high incomes live in districts more similar to those of low-income white families. My results demonstrate that the spatial inequalities created by income segregation between school districts contribute to achievement gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students, with implications for future research and policy.",https://openalex.org/W2767736630,https://openalex.org/W2767736630
ATTRICI v1.1 – counterfactual climate for impact attribution,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5269-2021,Matthias Mengel; Simon Treu; Stefan Lange; Katja Frieler,2021,,"Abstract. Attribution in its general definition aims to quantify drivers of change in a system. According to IPCC Working Group II (WGII) a change in a natural, human or managed system is attributed to climate change by quantifying the difference between the observed state of the system and a counterfactual baseline that characterizes the system's behavior in the absence of climate change, where “climate change refers to any long-term trend in climate, irrespective of its cause” (IPCC, 2014). Impact attribution following this definition remains a challenge because the counterfactual baseline, which characterizes the system behavior in the hypothetical absence of climate change, cannot be observed. Process-based and empirical impact models can fill this gap as they allow us to simulate the counterfactual climate impact baseline. In those simulations, the models are forced by observed direct (human) drivers such as land use changes, changes in water or agricultural management but a counterfactual climate without long-term changes. We here present ATTRICI (ATTRIbuting Climate Impacts), an approach to construct the required counterfactual stationary climate data from observational (factual) climate data. Our method identifies the long-term shifts in the considered daily climate variables that are correlated to global mean temperature change assuming a smooth annual cycle of the associated scaling coefficients for each day of the year. The produced counterfactual climate datasets are used as forcing data within the impact attribution setup of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP3a). Our method preserves the internal variability of the observed data in the sense that factual and counterfactual data for a given day have the same rank in their respective statistical distributions. The associated impact model simulations allow for quantifying the contribution of climate change to observed long-term changes in impact indicators and for quantifying the contribution of the observed trend in climate to the magnitude of individual impact events. Attribution of climate impacts to anthropogenic forcing would need an additional step separating anthropogenic climate forcing from other sources of climate trends, which is not covered by our method.",https://openalex.org/W3092205005,https://openalex.org/W3092205005

The study employed an endogenous switching regression approach to control for both observed and unobserved sources of heterogeneity between adopters and non-adopters. Our results showed that adoption of DTMVs increased maize yields by 13.3% and reduced the level of variance by 53% and downside risk exposure by 81% among adopters. This suggests that adoption had a ""win-win"" outcome by increasing maize yields and reducing exposure to drought risk. The gains in productivity and risk reduction due to adoption led to a reduction of 12.9% in the incidence of poverty and of 83.8% in the probability of food scarcity among adopters. The paper concluded that adoption of DTMVs was not just a simple coping strategy against drought but also a productivity enhancing and welfare improving strategy.

The Maunder minimum and the Little Ice Age: an update from recent reconstructions and climate simulations,https://doi.org/10.1051/swsc/2017034,M. J. Owens; M. Lockwood; Ed Hawkins; Ilya Usoskin; Gareth S. Jones; Luke Barnard; Andrew Schurer; John Fasullo,2017,,"The Maunder minimum (MM) was a period of extremely low solar activity from approximately AD 1650 to 1715. In the solar physics literature, the MM is sometimes associated with a period of cooler global temperatures, referred to as the Little Ice Age (LIA), and thus taken as compelling evidence of a large, direct solar influence on climate. In this study, we bring together existing simulation and observational studies, particularly the most recent solar activity and paleoclimate reconstructions, to examine this relation. Using northern hemisphere surface air temperature reconstructions, the LIA can be most readily defined as an approximately 480 year period spanning AD 1440–1920, although not all of this period was notably cold. While the MM occurred within the much longer LIA period, the timing of the features are not suggestive of causation and should not, in isolation, be used as evidence of significant solar forcing of climate. Climate model simulations suggest multiple factors, particularly volcanic activity, were crucial for causing the cooler temperatures in the northern hemisphere during the LIA. A reduction in total solar irradiance likely contributed to the LIA at a level comparable to changing land use.",https://openalex.org/W2774328673,https://openalex.org/W2774328673

This review summarises the recent literature relating to the effects of climatic factors on the incidence of HFRS in China and discusses future research directions. Temperature, precipitation and humidity affect crop yields, rodent breeding patterns and disease transmission, and these can be influenced by a changing climate.

Brain disorders? Not really: Why network structures block reductionism in psychopathology research,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0140525x17002266,Denny Borsboom; Angélique O. J. Cramer; Annemarie Kalis,2018,,"Abstract In the past decades, reductionism has dominated both research directions and funding policies in clinical psychology and psychiatry. The intense search for the biological basis of mental disorders, however, has not resulted in conclusive reductionist explanations of psychopathology. Recently, network models have been proposed as an alternative framework for the analysis of mental disorders, in which mental disorders arise from the causal interplay between symptoms. In this target article, we show that this conceptualization can help explain why reductionist approaches in psychiatry and clinical psychology are on the wrong track. First, symptom networks preclude the identification of a common cause of symptomatology with a neurobiological condition; in symptom networks, there is no such common cause. Second, symptom network relations depend on the content of mental states and, as such, feature intentionality. Third, the strength of network relations is highly likely to depend partially on cultural and historical contexts as well as external mechanisms in the environment. Taken together, these properties suggest that, if mental disorders are indeed networks of causally related symptoms, reductionist accounts cannot achieve the level of success associated with reductionist disease models in modern medicine. As an alternative strategy, we propose to interpret network structures in terms of D. C. Dennett's (1987) notion of real patterns , and suggest that, instead of being reducible to a biological basis, mental disorders feature biological and psychological factors that are deeply intertwined in feedback loops.

In this paper, we assess the current distribution of heat exposure within countries, to explore possible distributional consequences of climate change through temperature. Combining survey data from 690,745 households across 52 countries with spatial data on climate, this paper suggests that the welfare impacts of added heat stress may be regressive within countries. We find: (1) a strong negative correlation between household wealth and warmer temperature in many hot countries; (2) a strong positive correlation between household wealth and warmer temperatures in many cold countries; and (3) that poorer individuals are more likely to work in occupations with greater exposure. While our analysis is descriptive rather than causal, our results suggest a larger vulnerability of poor people to heat extremes, and potentially significant distributional and poverty implications of climate change.",https://openalex.org/W3021562645,https://openalex.org/W3021562645
Exploring the impact of R&amp;D and climate change on agricultural productivity growth: the case of Western Australia*,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8489.2010.00514.x,Ruhul Salim; Nazrul Islam,2010,,"This article empirically examines the impact of R&amp;D and climate change on the Western Australian Agricultural sector using standard time series econometrics. Based on historical data for the period of 1977–2005, the empirical results show that both R&amp;D and climate change matter for long‐run productivity growth. The long‐run elasticity of total factor productivity (TFP) with respect to R&amp;D expenditure is 0.497, while that of climate change is 0.506. There is a unidirectional causality running from R&amp;D expenditure to TFP growth in both the short run and long run. Further, the variance decomposition and impulse response function confirm that a significant portion of output and productivity growth beyond the sample period is explained by R&amp;D expenditure. These results justify the increase in R&amp;D investment in the deteriorating climatic condition in the agricultural sector to improve the long‐run prospects of productivity growth.",https://openalex.org/W1579929514,https://openalex.org/W1579929514

Harnik,2015,,"Abstract Competition among organisms has ecological and evolutionary consequences. However, whether the consequences of competition are manifested and measureable on macroevolutionary time scales is equivocal. Marine bivalves and brachiopods have overlapping niches such that competition for food and space may occur. Moreover, there is a long‐standing debate over whether bivalves outcompeted brachiopods evolutionarily, because brachiopod diversity declined through time while bivalve diversity increased. To answer this question, we estimate the origination and extinction dynamics of fossil marine bivalve and brachiopod genera from the Ordovician through to the Recent while simultaneously accounting for incomplete sampling. Then, using stochastic differential equations, we assess statistical relationships among diversification and sampling dynamics of brachiopods and bivalves and five paleoenvironmental proxies. None of these potential environmental drivers had any detectable influence on brachiopod or bivalve diversification. In contrast, elevated bivalve extinction rates causally increased brachiopod origination rates, suggesting that bivalves have suppressed brachiopod evolution.",https://openalex.org/W2121473102,https://openalex.org/W2121473102

"Class Mortality Differentials, Income Distribution and Trends in Poverty 1921–1981",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0047279400017591,Richard G. Wilkinson,1989,,"ABSTRACT The official figures which appear to show a widening of class differences in health in England and Wales during the post-war period have been controversial partly because they do not fit with common perceptions of what has happened to differences in the standard of living. As a result, a great deal of effort has gone into investigating suggested weaknesses in the decennial social class mortality data. Though initially plausible, the artifactual and selective explanations of the widening mortality differences which were put forward have not usually been borne out by closer investigations. The only fault in the broad picture presented by the official data which we do perhaps need to bear in mind is the tendency for a narrowing of mortality differentials among younger women to be masked by the widening among older women. This paper is an attempt to look at the other side of the coin—namely, to investigate trends in differences in the standard of living in relation to mortality differentials. It concludes that trends in mortality differences have not been related to trends in class differences in average earnings, but have been fairly clearly related to trends in relative poverty. Relative poverty and class differences in mortality declined before the war but have both increased, decade by decade, since the war. Younger women have perhaps been protected from the increase in relative poverty during much of the post-war period by their increased economic activity rates and the relative improvement in earnings of women in poorly paid manual occupations.",https://openalex.org/W2056227789,https://openalex.org/W2056227789

I trace the history of both these views through the writings of the founders of macroecology. I also highlight the transmutation principle that identifies serious limitations to the study of large‐scale systems with reductionist approaches. And I suggest that much of the underlying goal of macroecology is the pursuit of general principles and the escape from contingency. I highlight that there are many intertwined aspects of macroecology, with a number of resulting implications. I propose that returning to a focus on studying assemblages of a large number of particles is a helpful view. I propose defining macroecology as “the study at the aggregate level of aggregate ecological entities made up of large numbers of particles for the purposes of pursuing generality”.",https://openalex.org/W2907494903,https://openalex.org/W2907494903

Neighborhood Environment and Intimate Partner Violence,https://doi.org/10.1177/1524838013515758,Kirsten Beyer; Anne Wallis; L. Kevin Hamberger,2013,,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is an important global public health problem, affecting women across the life span and increasing risk for a number of unfavorable health outcomes. Typically conceptualized as a private form of violence, most research has focused on individual-level risk markers. Recently, more scholarly attention has been paid to the role that the residential neighborhood environment may play in influencing the occurrence of IPV. With research accumulating since the 1990s, increasing prominence of the topic, and no comprehensive literature reviews yet undertaken, it is time to take stock of what is known, what remains unknown, and the methods and concepts investigators have considered. In this article, we undertake a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature to date on the relationship between neighborhood environment and IPV, asking, “what is the status of scholarship related to the association between neighborhood environment and IPV occurrence?” Although the literature is young, it is receiving increasing attention from researchers in sociology, public health, criminology, and other fields. Obvious gaps in the literature include limited consideration of nonurban areas, limited theoretical motivation, and limited consideration of the range of potential contributors to environmental effects on IPV—such as built environmental factors or access to services. In addition, explanations of the pathways by which place influences the occurrence of IPV draw mainly from social disorganization theory that was developed in urban settings in the United States and may need to be adapted, especially to be useful in explaining residential environmental correlates of IPV in rural or non-U.S. settings. A more complete theoretical understanding of the relationship between neighborhood environment and IPV, especially considering differences among urban, semiurban, and rural settings and developed and developing country settings, will be necessary to advance research questions and improve policy and intervention responses to reduce the burden of IPV.",https://openalex.org/W2093965844,https://openalex.org/W2093965844

I address this question by investigating the effects of capital and trade flows on government welfare spending in fifty-three developing countries. Using an original measure of labor power in developing countries, I test the links between international markets, labor's political strength, and the welfare state. I argue that labor's collective-action problems, caused by large populations of low-skilled and surplus workers, offset labor's potential political gains from globalization. I show that when the proportion of low-skilled workers in a nation is high, globalization will lead to a decline in welfare spending. Most significantly, the results suggest that in nations where labor-market institutions are not yet well developed, government social-welfare spending is constrained by international market, forces.",https://openalex.org/W2127666958,https://openalex.org/W2127666958

First it illustrates and discusses some of the challenges related to the measurement of resilience by reviewing some of the most recently published and grey literature on resilience in relation to food security. Second it proposes a new framework that addresses some of the concerns and limitations of resilience measurement identified in that literature. The main postulate of this framework is that the ‘costs of resilience’ (that is, the different ex‐ante and ex‐post investments, losses, sacrifices, and costs that people have to undertake at individual and collective levels to ‘go through’ a shock or an adverse event) provide an appropriate and independent metric to measure resilience across scales and dimensions. The paper shows how the independent nature of this metrics offers an explanatory power that can be used to infer, in a testable and rigorous manner potential, causalities between the metric and household and/or community characteristics. Empirical and theoretical examples are used throughout the paper to illustrate the arguments.",https://openalex.org/W1999800612,https://openalex.org/W1999800612

Why do urbanites travel more than do others? A review of associations between urban form and long-distance leisure travel,https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aac9d2,Michał Czepkiewicz; Jukka Heinonen; Juudit Ottelin,2018,,"Negative relationships between urban density and greenhouse gas emissions from daily travel are well established in the literature. However, recent research suggests that higher urban density is associated with higher emissions from long-distance leisure travel, such as car weekend trips and international flights. This article presents the first systematic review of empirical evidence on these associations and discusses potential explanations. A two-step article selection process yielded 27 empirical articles, complemented by one article published during the review process. When international travel is included in the analysis, the results suggest that residents of the largest cities, and particularly those from centrally located and densely built areas, travel more to cover long distances than do others, after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic variables. When only domestic travel is included, residents of larger settlements and areas of higher density engage in less long-distance travel for leisure purposes than those living in smaller settlements and sparsely built areas. The results of the review are indicative and warrant more research. Generalization is currently limited because of the wide variety of travel behavior measures used, consideration of different travel modes and trip purposes, and geographic scope. There is a strong need for replication of the results using consistent methodology, using data from longer and more recent time spans, and expanding to more diverse geographical settings, especially outside Europe. The systematic review is followed by a narrative review of theoretical explanations of the associations. The most common explanations include: rebound effects, the compensation hypothesis, access to transport infrastructure, urban lifestyles, sociopsychological characteristics, and social networks. Socioeconomic variables are controlled in a majority of the reviewed studies, and business travel is excluded from the review, so the concentration of wealth and business in cities may explain the findings only to some extent. Nonetheless, there is not enough empirical evidence on the causal character of the associations and therefore further qualitative and multidisciplinary work is needed.

Brunnschweiler; Erwin Bulte,2009,,"In this paper we examine the claim that natural resources invite civil conflict, and challenge the main stylized facts in this literature.We find that the conventional measure of resource dependence is endogenous with respect to conflict, and that instrumenting for dependence implies that it is no longer significant in conflict regressions.Instead, it appears that conflict increases dependence on resource extraction (as a default sector).Moreover, resource abundance is associated with a reduced probability of the onset of war.These results are robust to a range of specifications and, considering the conflict channel, we conclude there is no reason to regard resources as a general curse to peace and development.",https://openalex.org/W2128395238,https://openalex.org/W2128395238
Do infant vocabulary skills predict school‐age language and literacy outcomes?,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.12378,Fiona J. Duff; Gurpreet Reen; Kim Plunkett; Kate Nation,2015,,"Background Strong associations between infant vocabulary and school‐age language and literacy skills would have important practical and theoretical implications: Preschool assessment of vocabulary skills could be used to identify children at risk of reading and language difficulties, and vocabulary could be viewed as a cognitive foundation for reading. However, evidence to date suggests predictive ability from infant vocabulary to later language and literacy is low. This study provides an investigation into, and interpretation of, the magnitude of such infant to school‐age relationships. Methods Three hundred British infants whose vocabularies were assessed by parent report in the 2nd year of life (between 16 and 24 months) were followed up on average 5 years later (ages ranged from 4 to 9 years), when their vocabulary, phonological and reading skills were measured. Results Structural equation modelling of age‐regressed scores was used to assess the strength of longitudinal relationships. Infant vocabulary (a latent factor of receptive and expressive vocabulary) was a statistically significant predictor of later vocabulary, phonological awareness, reading accuracy and reading comprehension (accounting for between 4% and 18% of variance). Family risk for language or literacy difficulties explained additional variance in reading (approximately 10%) but not language outcomes. Conclusions Significant longitudinal relationships between preliteracy vocabulary knowledge and subsequent reading support the theory that vocabulary is a cognitive foundation of both reading accuracy and reading comprehension. Importantly however, the stability of vocabulary skills from infancy to later childhood is too low to be sufficiently predictive of language outcomes at an individual level – a finding that fits well with the observation that the majority of ‘late talkers’ resolve their early language difficulties. For reading outcomes, prediction of future difficulties is likely to be improved when considering family history of language/literacy difficulties alongside infant vocabulary levels.",https://openalex.org/W2145476850,https://openalex.org/W2145476850

Therefore the resources that might reduce its negative outcomes on well-being and job attitudes come into focus. Our study contributes to the work–family conflict literature by exploring the indirect (moderator) and direct role of three work- and organization-related resources, i.e., job control, family supportive climate, organization-based self-esteem (OBSE), in the work-to-family conflict and well-being/job attitude relationship. Theoretically, the study tested the recently developed Job Demands–Resources (JD-R) model in the Scandinavian context. Data for the study were gathered from three differing Finnish organizations (health care district, ICT company, Cardboard mill; n=1252). In line with the predictions of the JD-R model, job demands (time- and strain-based work-to-family conflict) were more robustly associated with strain-based outcomes (physical symptoms), whereas job resources (job control, family supportive climate, OBSE) were more strongly linked to motivational-based outcomes (job satisfaction, organizational commitment). Both job control and family supportive climate moderated the relationships studied; high job control and family supportive climate buffered against the aversive effects of work-to-family conflict on well-being and job attitudes. These indirect effects also varied in relation to the independent, moderator, and dependent variables. However, OBSE did not operate as a buffering factor, although it showed significant direct effects. From a practical viewpoint, our findings suggest that job control and family supportive climate are resources that help employees to reduce the negative effects related to work–family conflict.",https://openalex.org/W2146608504,https://openalex.org/W2146608504

Population growth increases the overall demand for food, while income growth affects consumption patterns. Using annual aggregate data from the World Bank in 2001–2020 and econometric approaches, this research investigates the changes in the growth rates in rural and urban populations and GDP per capita and the prevalence of undernourishment as % of the population in low-income countries, lower-middle-income countries, and upper-middle income countries. The main goal of the study is to convey a deeper understanding by quantifying the impacts of rural and urban population growth as well as GDP per capita growth on the prevalence of undernourishment. The robust regression models showed that the prevalence of undernourishment in these countries was strongly associated with rural and urban population growth. A positive impact of rural population growth on undernutrition was found in all three groups of countries, with the most significant positive effects found in upper-middle-income countries. The negative effect of urban population growth on undernourishment was largest for the upper middle-income countries. Furthermore, fully modified ordinary least squares results revealed that the changes in the prevalence of undernourishment are mostly associated with long-term changes in the rural and urban population growth. The Difference in Difference (DiD) estimation confirmed only the causal effect of rural population growth on the prevalence of undernourishment in the panel of these countries.

Combining geo-spatial data on eight environmental risks and household survey data from 2010–2014 for the case study of Vietnam, this paper shows: (i) at the district level, the incidence of poverty is higher in high risk areas, (ii) at the household level, poorer households face higher environmental risks, (iii) for some risks the relationship with household-level consumption varies between rural and urban areas, and (iv) environmental risks explain consumption differences between households, but less so changes over time. While altogether these analyses cannot establish a causal relationship between environmental risks and poverty, they do indicate that Vietnam's poor are disproportionally exposed. Given growing pressures due to climate change, addressing such risks should be a focus of poverty reduction efforts.",https://openalex.org/W2795405323,https://openalex.org/W2795405323

Design/methodology/approach A ten minute pen and paper questionnaire was distributed to undergraduate and postgraduate students in a large Western Australia university through a non‐probability, convenience sampling approach. In total, 228 useable responses were collected, achieving a 60 per cent response rate. Findings The empirical results from the structural model suggest that satisfaction (SAT) with the attractiveness, quality, and value provided by the destination positively influenced RVI. Perceived risk did not have the predicted effects on SAT and RVI. Research limitations/implications Convenience sampling method restricts the representativeness of results across all university students. Future studies can examine the influences of culture, national and multiculturism on RVI of tourist destinations. This study can also be replicated with larger sample sizes.

Michler,2016,,"We analyse the impact of improved chickpea adoption on welfare in Ethiopia using three rounds of panel data. First, we estimate the determinants of improved chickpea adoption using a double hurdle model. We apply a control function approach with correlated random effects to control for possible endogeneity resulting from access to improved seed and technology transfer activities. To instrument for these variables we develop novel distance weighted measures of a household's neighbours' access to improved seed and technology transfer activities. Second, we estimate the impact of area under improved chickpea cultivation on household income and poverty. We apply a fixed effects instrumental variables approach where we use the predicted area under cultivation from the double hurdle model as an instrument for observed area under cultivation. We find that improved chickpea adoption significantly increases household income while also reducing household poverty. Finally, we disaggregate results by landholding to explore whether the impact of adoption has heterogeneous effects. Adoption favoured all but the largest landholders, for who the new technology did not have a significant impact on income. Overall, increasing access to improved chickpea appears a promising pathway for rural development in Ethiopia's chickpea growing regions.",https://openalex.org/W2528267702,https://openalex.org/W2528267702

In the Nordic region, some of these hazards are projected to change their frequency and intensity in the future, while at the same time strong increases are projected in the proportion of elderly in the population. This paper reports results from three projects studying the potential impacts of climate change on elderly people in the Nordic region. An interactive web-based tool has been developed for mapping and combining indicators of climate change vulnerability of the elderly, by municipality, across three Nordic countries: Finland, Norway and Sweden. The tool can also be used for projecting temperature-related mortality in Finland under different projections of future climate. The approach to vulnerability mapping differs from most previous studies in which researchers selected the indicators to combine into an index. Here, while researchers compile data on indicators that can be accessed in the mapping tool, the onus is on the users of the tool to decide which indicators are of interest and whether to map them individually or as combined indices. Stakeholders with responsibility for the care and welfare of the elderly were engaged in the study through interviews and a workshop. They affirmed the usefulness of the prototype mapping tool for raising awareness about climate change as a potential risk factor for the elderly and offered suggestions on potential refinements, which have now been implemented. These included adding background information on possible adaptation measures for ameliorating the impacts of extreme temperatures, and improved representation of uncertainties in projections of future exposure and adaptive capacity.",https://openalex.org/W2092377435,https://openalex.org/W2092377435

This paper turns to U.S. county data on land inequality over the period 1890 to 1930 to help address this fundamental question in political economy. Redistributive policy was primarily decided at the local level during this period, making county-level data particularly informative. Examining within-state variation also reduces the potential impact of latent institutional and political variables. The paper also uses a variety of identification strategies, including historic variables as well as county weather and crop characteristics, as instruments for land inequality. The evidence consistently suggests that greater inequality is significantly associated with less redistribution. This negative relationship is especially large in heavily rural counties, where concentrated landownership implied that landed elites also controlled the majority of economic production.",https://openalex.org/W3124903304,https://openalex.org/W3124903304

While physical knowledge about the involved mechanisms is often available, how to quantify a particular causal pathway from data are usually unclear.

A causal approach requires explicitly including expert knowledge in the statistical analysis, which allows one to draw quantitative conclusions. We illustrate some of the key concepts of this theory with concrete examples of well-known atmospheric teleconnections.

The destruction of the environment presents a serious threat to human existence. South Africa, like several nations, has been working on reducing its dependence on fossil fuels such as coal by utilizing modern energy-efficient technologies that allow to establish a more carbon-neutral economy. Several attempts have been made to identify the major sources of environmental deterioration. Within the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) framework from 1960 to 2020, this study aims to check empirically the effect of fiscal decentralization (FD), green technological innovation (GI), trade openness (OPEN), population size (POP), per capita GDP (GDP), per capita GDP squared (GDP2), institutional quality (INS), and energy consumption (EC) on carbon emissions (CO2) in South Africa, as given its fast economic progress the country is facing problems with CO2 emission. The recently developed novel dynamic autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL)-simulations framework has been used. The outcomes of the analysis indicate that (i) FD, GI, and INS improve environmental sustainability in both the short and long run; (ii) OPEN deteriorates environmental quality in the long run, although it is environmentally friendly in the short run; (iii) per capita GDP increases CO2 emissions, whereas its square contributes to lower it, thus validating the presence of an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis; (iii) POP and EC contribute to environmental deterioration in both the short and long run; and (iv) FD, GI, OPEN, POP, GDP, GDP2, INS, and EC Granger cause CO2 in the medium, long, and short run, suggesting that these variables are important to influence environmental sustainability. In light of our empirical evidence, this paper suggests that the international teamwork necessary to lessen carbon emissions is immensely critical to solve the growing trans-boundary environmental decay and other associated spillover consequences. Moreover, it is important to explain responsibilities at different tiers of government to effectively meet the objectives of low CO2 emissions and energy-saving fiscal expenditure functions.",https://openalex.org/W4293817138,https://openalex.org/W4293817138
Global warming and urbanization,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00148-022-00924-y,Marc Helbling; Daniel Meierrieks,2022,,"Abstract Analyzing 118 countries between 1960 and 2016, we find that higher temperatures correlate with higher urbanization rates in the long run, where this relationship is much more pronounced than any short-term linkage. The long-run relationship between global warming and urbanization is also conditional upon country-specific conditions. This long-run association is especially relevant in poorer and more agriculture-dependent countries with an urban bias as well as in initially non-urban countries in hotter climate zones. We also provide suggestive evidence that warming contributes to losses in agricultural productivity and to pro-urban shifts in public goods provision and that the global warming-urbanization nexus is partly mediated through these channels. Consequently, we argue that the estimated long-run relationship between temperature and urbanization partly captures the potential impact of increasing temperatures on urbanization via a rural push (by impairing agriculture) and an urban pull (via an increased demand for public goods primarily supplied in cities).",https://openalex.org/W4298395879,https://openalex.org/W4298395879

A CNN-Based Fusion Method for Feature Extraction from Sentinel Data,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10020236,Giuseppe Scarpa; Massimiliano Gargiulo; A Mazza; Raffaele Gaetano,2018,,"Sensitivity to weather conditions, and specially to clouds, is a severe limiting factor to the use of optical remote sensing for Earth monitoring applications. A possible alternative is to benefit from weather-insensitive synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In many real-world applications, critical decisions are made based on some informative optical or radar features related to items such as water, vegetation or soil. Under cloudy conditions, however, optical-based features are not available, and they are commonly reconstructed through linear interpolation between data available at temporally-close time instants. In this work, we propose to estimate missing optical features through data fusion and deep-learning. Several sources of information are taken into account—optical sequences, SAR sequences, digital elevation model—so as to exploit both temporal and cross-sensor dependencies. Based on these data and a tiny cloud-free fraction of the target image, a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to perform the desired estimation. To validate the proposed approach, we focus on the estimation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), using coupled Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series acquired over an agricultural region of Burkina Faso from May–November 2016. Several fusion schemes are considered, causal and non-causal, single-sensor or joint-sensor, corresponding to different operating conditions. Experimental results are very promising, showing a significant gain over baseline methods according to all performance indicators.",https://openalex.org/W2778936354,https://openalex.org/W2778936354
Relationships between Antarctic cyclones and surface conditions as derived from high-resolution numerical weather prediction data,https://doi.org/10.1029/2010jd015358,Petteri Uotila; Timo Vihma; Alexandre Bernardes Pezza; Ian Simmonds; Kevin Keay; Amanda H. Lynch,2011,,"[1] An Antarctic cyclone climatology was created based on simulations of the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) and the University of Melbourne Cyclone (UM) detection and tracking algorithm for the period 2001–2009. Over 17,000 cyclone tracks were included in the climatology, and 20% of these cyclones were mesoscale in terms of their size. Mesoscale systems were common south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Trough (ACT) over the coastal oceans of the Indian Ocean sector and in the Ross Sea, while large synoptic systems occurred most frequently in the ACT. A novel technique was applied to study the relationships between cyclone characteristics and surface properties over the Southern Ocean and the coastal areas of Antarctica. Our comprehensive study has revealed that up to half of the cyclones simulated by AMPS correlated with the surface latent heat flux, sensible heat flux, or temperature gradient. These cyclones either modified the surface or were being modified by it. In the former category, 85% of the systems were synoptic cyclones associated predominantly with baroclinicity and advection, and the atmospheric boundary layer had a little influence in the generation and development of cyclones. On the contrary, in the latter category, 36% of the systems were mesoscale cyclones gaining energy from instabilities in the boundary layer associated with strong turbulent fluxes.",https://openalex.org/W2082468718,https://openalex.org/W2082468718

Anticholinergic Drug Exposure and the Risk of Dementia,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2019.0677,Carol Coupland; Trevor Hill; Tom Dening; Richard Morriss; Michael Moore; Julia Hippisley‐Cox,2019,,"Anticholinergic medicines have short-term cognitive adverse effects, but it is uncertain whether long-term use of these drugs is associated with an increased risk of dementia.To assess associations between anticholinergic drug treatments and risk of dementia in persons 55 years or older.This nested case-control study took place in general practices in England that contributed to the QResearch primary care database. The study evaluated whether exposure to anticholinergic drugs was associated with dementia risk in 58 769 patients with a diagnosis of dementia and 225 574 controls 55 years or older matched by age, sex, general practice, and calendar time. Information on prescriptions for 56 drugs with strong anticholinergic properties was used to calculate measures of cumulative anticholinergic drug exposure. Data were analyzed from May 2016 to June 2018.The primary exposure was the total standardized daily doses (TSDDs) of anticholinergic drugs prescribed in the 1 to 11 years prior to the date of diagnosis of dementia or equivalent date in matched controls (index date).Odds ratios (ORs) for dementia associated with cumulative exposure to anticholinergic drugs, adjusted for confounding variables.Of the entire study population (284 343 case patients and matched controls), 179 365 (63.1%) were women, and the mean (SD) age of the entire population was 82.2 (6.8) years. The adjusted OR for dementia increased from 1.06 (95% CI, 1.03-1.09) in the lowest overall anticholinergic exposure category (total exposure of 1-90 TSDDs) to 1.49 (95% CI, 1.44-1.54) in the highest category (>1095 TSDDs), compared with no anticholinergic drug prescriptions in the 1 to 11 years before the index date. There were significant increases in dementia risk for the anticholinergic antidepressants (adjusted OR [AOR], 1.29; 95% CI, 1.24-1.34), antiparkinson drugs (AOR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.16-2.00), antipsychotics (AOR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.53-1.90), bladder antimuscarinic drugs (AOR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.56-1.75), and antiepileptic drugs (AOR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.22-1.57) all for more than 1095 TSDDs. Results were similar when exposures were restricted to exposure windows of 3 to 13 years (AOR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.41-1.52) and 5 to 20 years (AOR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.32-1.57) before the index date for more than 1095 TSDDs. Associations were stronger in cases diagnosed before the age of 80 years. The population-attributable fraction associated with total anticholinergic drug exposure during the 1 to 11 years before diagnosis was 10.3%.Exposure to several types of strong anticholinergic drugs is associated with an increased risk of dementia. These findings highlight the importance of reducing exposure to anticholinergic drugs in middle-aged and older people.",https://openalex.org/W2939971450,https://openalex.org/W2939971450

Explaining transit ridership: What has the evidence shown?,https://doi.org/10.1179/1942786712z.0000000003,Brian D. Taylor; Camille Fink,2013,,"What explains transit ridership? The answer to this simple question is both obvious and complex. Public transit systems carry large shares of person travel in older, larger metropolitan areas around the globe, but in most places, old and new, large and small, transit is losing market share to private vehicles. A host of factors no doubt influence transit ridership, including fares, routing, service frequency, stop/station accessibility, safety, private vehicle ownership levels, population density, land use, parking availability, and cost. But the relative importance of these factors and the ways they influence one another is less well understood. At the same time, the relationships between these factors and transit ridership are central to public policy debates about transportation system investments and the pricing and deployment of transit services. The research explaining transit ridership is surprisingly uneven, spanning a variety of methodological approaches, data sources, and variables that produce, perhaps not surprisingly, somewhat ambiguous, contradictory, and inconsistent results. Yet the factors affecting transit ridership are not simply matters of academic interest. Public investment in transit is waxing in response to the many problems of auto dependence, worsening traffic congestion, rising fuel prices, vehicle emissions, and so on. What can be done to increase patronage and better leverage these investments? To address this question, this paper reviews research on transit use, critiques the sometimes significant weaknesses in much of the previous work on this topic, draws conclusions from the more rigorous studies about which factors most influence transit use, and presents recommendations for future research.",https://openalex.org/W2010903698,https://openalex.org/W2010903698
The link between short sleep duration and obesity: we should recommend more sleep to prevent obesity,https://doi.org/10.1136/adc.2005.093013,Shahrad Taheri,2006,,"Sleep may affect energy balance. Sleep may not be the only answer to the obesity pandemic, but its effect should be considered seriously, as even small changes in the energy balance are beneficial. Good sleep could be part of the obesity prevention approach.

We are currently facing a major obesity pandemic. Most alarming is the accelerated increase in overweight and obesity in children, with childhood obesity tracking into adulthood. Although there is a strong genetic contribution to obesity, the current pandemic has been driven by environmental factors. Unfortunately, interventions aiming to alter food selection (eg, less fat and sugar) and calorie intake (eg, smaller portions) and to increase physical activity have not been able to result in long-term weight loss and maintenance. These approaches are confounded by the fact that only an insignificant daily energy surplus could result in obesity over time. Although changes in the basic balance between energy intake (food calories) and expenditure (physical activity) are obviously responsible for the current obesity pandemic, our understanding of the factors that alter this balance remains incomplete. Intriguingly, sleep may be a factor that alters both sides of the energy balance equation. The precise physiological functions of sleep are unknown, but the contribution of sleep to physical and psychological health, and its social and economic significance, is increasingly recognised.1 Sleep research has mainly concentrated on the cognitive consequences of sleep loss, on the basis of the belief that sleep is for the brain alone. Recently, however, there has been a shift in interest in the consequences of sleep loss for other organs and several physiological systems. Also, more laboratory studies on sleep are now concentrating on investigating the health and performance effects of chronic partial sleep restriction, which is truer of real life, rather than acute total sleep deprivation.

While it has been argued that urban vitality – the liveliness of cities – may strengthen social cohesion, this has not been sufficiently examined by empirical research. This paper presents and tests a model in which urban vitality mediates the relationship between built environment characteristics and neighborhood social cohesion, using survey and geospatial data from the Oslo metropolitan area. We find that neighborhood density and land use mix are positive predictors of urban vitality, but are negatively associated with social cohesion. Green space is found to be associated with lower urban vitality, while public transport accessibility is associated with higher social cohesion. Results indicate seemingly contradictory relationships between the built environment, urban vitality and social cohesion. On the one hand, although compact urban form has higher levels of urban vitality, it has lower levels of social cohesion compared to low-density, single-use urban form. On the other hand, for similar urban form types, urban vitality is found to be positively associated with social cohesion, suggesting that local initiatives and interventions aiming to increase residents’ walking and social activity within their neighborhood could also strengthen social cohesion.",https://openalex.org/W3087432152,https://openalex.org/W3087432152

A considerable literature seeks to answer this question, yet concerns about reverse causality threaten the validity of extant conclusions. To estimate the impact of poverty on conflict and to determine whether the relationship between them is causal, it is necessary to identify a source of exogenous variation in poverty. We do this by introducing a robust instrument for poverty: a time-varying measure of international inequalities. We draw upon existing theories about the structural position of a country in the international economic network—specifically, the expectation that countries in the core tend to be wealthier and those on the periphery struggle to develop. This instrument is plausibly exogenous and satisfies the exclusion restriction, which suggests that it affects conflict only through its influence upon poverty. Instrumental variables probit regression is employed to demonstrate that the impact of poverty upon conflict appears to be causal.",https://openalex.org/W2049875132,https://openalex.org/W2049875132

Analysis of Effects of Meteorological Factors on Dengue Incidence in Sri Lanka Using Time Series Data,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0063717,Kensuke Goto; Balachandran Kumarendran; Sachith Mettananda; Deepa Gunasekara; Yoshito Fujii; Satoshi Kaneko,2013,,"In tropical and subtropical regions of eastern and South-eastern Asia, dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) outbreaks occur frequently. Previous studies indicate an association between meteorological variables and dengue incidence using time series analyses. The impacts of meteorological changes can affect dengue outbreak. However, difficulties in collecting detailed time series data in developing countries have led to common use of monthly data in most previous studies. In addition, time series analyses are often limited to one area because of the difficulty in collecting meteorological and dengue incidence data in multiple areas. To gain better understanding, we examined the effects of meteorological factors on dengue incidence in three geographically distinct areas (Ratnapura, Colombo, and Anuradhapura) of Sri Lanka by time series analysis of weekly data. The weekly average maximum temperature and total rainfall and the total number of dengue cases from 2005 to 2011 (7 years) were used as time series data in this study. Subsequently, time series analyses were performed on the basis of ordinary least squares regression analysis followed by the vector autoregressive model (VAR). In conclusion, weekly average maximum temperatures and the weekly total rainfall did not significantly affect dengue incidence in three geographically different areas of Sri Lanka. However, the weekly total rainfall slightly influenced dengue incidence in the cities of Colombo and Anuradhapura.",https://openalex.org/W2081643566,https://openalex.org/W2081643566

Evans; David J. Hearn; William J. Hahn; Jennifer M. Spangle; D. Lawrence Venable,2005,,"Abstract Evolutionary ecologists have long sought to understand the conditions under which perennial (iteroparous) versus annual (semelparous) plant life histories are favored. We evaluated the idea that aridity and variation in the length of droughts should favor the evolution of an annual life history, both by decreasing adult survival and by increasing the potential for high seedling survival via reduced plant cover. We calculated phylogenetically independent contrasts of climate with respect to life history in a clade of winter-establishing evening primroses (sections Anogra and Kleinia; Oenothera; Onagraceae), which includes seven annuals, 12 perennials, and two variable taxa. Climate variables were quantified from long-term records at weather stations near collection localities. To explicitly account for phylogenetic uncertainty, contrasts were calculated on a random sample of phylogenetic trees from the posterior distribution of a Bayesian analysis of DNA sequence data. Statements of association are based on comparing the pertree mean contrast, which has a null expectation of zero, to a set of per-tree mean contrasts calculated on the same trees, after randomizing the climate data. As predicted, increased annual aridity, increased annual potential evapotranspiration, and decreased annual precipitation were associated with transitions to the annual habit, but these trends were not significantly different from the null pattern. Transitions to the annual habit were not significantly associated with increases in one measure of aridity in summer nor with increased summer drought, but they were associated with significantly increased maximum summer temperatures. In winter, increased aridity and decreased precipitation were significantly associated with transitions to the annual habit. Changes in life history were not significantly associated with changes in the coefficient of variation of precipitation, either on an annual or seasonal (summer vs. winter) basis. Though we cannot attribute causality on the basis of a correlational, historical study, our results are consistent with the idea that increased heat and drought at certain times of the year favor the evolution of the annual habit. Increased heat in summer may cause adult survival to decline, while increased aridity and decreased precipitation in the season of seedling recruitment (winter) may favor a drought-avoiding, short-lived annual strategy. Not all of the predicted patterns were observed: the capability for drought-induced dormancy may preclude change in habit in response to summer drought in our study group.",https://openalex.org/W2179817406,https://openalex.org/W2179817406
The Relationship Between Crime and Opioid Use<sup>⋆</sup>,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1360-0443.1989.tb00786.x,Richard Hammersley; Alasdair Forsyth; Valerie Morrison; John B. Davies,1989,,"Summary Accepting that opioid use and crime are associated and develop together, amongst opioid‐using criminals the need for opioids may cause crime on a day‐to‐day basis or both may tend to be determined by some other set of factors. Previous studies have either failed to allow for such other factors, or have failed to compare opioid users to adequate control groups. From interviews with 151 Scottish prisoners and non‐prisoners, divided into five drug‐using groups: (1) alcohol only; (2) cannabis and alcohol; (3) other drugs but not opioids; (4) moderate opioids; (5) heavy opioids, data were obtained on drug use frequency, crime frequency and a variety of other variables. It was found that: (1) there were no differences between incarcerated and non‐incarcerated opioid users, in fact incarceration had no substantial effects on other variables; (2) heavy opioid users committed crimes significantly more frequently than did moderate opioid users, non‐opioid poly drug users, cannabis users or alcohol users. But, moderate opioid users did not commit crimes significantly more frequently than did the other groups; (3) other drugs were related to crime. Polydrug use (including cannabis use) was more related to theft and delinquency than was opioid use. Alcohol use was related to fraud; (4) there were larger explanations of crime than opioid use—criminal experience and polydrug use—and crime was a better explanation of opioid use variance than opioid use was of crime. It is concluded that need for opioids did not simply cause crime. Rather, crime and opioid use tended to influence each other. However, this relationship was not special to opioids but, depending on historical circumstances, could—and to some extent does—apply to any drug. In consequence, society's treatment of drug‐using criminals needs to deal with drug use and crime together.",https://openalex.org/W2095223098,https://openalex.org/W2095223098

DeRouen; Theresa H.M. Keegan; Irene H. Yen; Mahasin S. Mujahid; William A. Satariano; Sally L. Glaser,2015,,"Neighborhood social and built environments have been recognized as important contexts in which health is shaped. The authors reviewed the extent to which these neighborhood factors have been addressed in population-level cancer research by scanning the literature for research focused on specific social and/or built environment characteristics and their association with outcomes across the cancer continuum, including incidence, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and survival. The commonalities and differences in methodologies across studies, the current challenges in research methodology, and future directions in this research also were addressed. The assessment of social and built environment factors in relation to cancer is a relatively new field, with 82% of the 34 reviewed articles published since 2010. Across the wide range of social and built environment exposures and cancer outcomes considered by the studies, numerous associations were reported. However, the directions and magnitudes of associations varied, in large part because of the variation in cancer sites and outcomes studied, but also likely because of differences in study populations, geographic regions, and, importantly, choice of neighborhood measures and geographic scales. The authors recommend that future studies consider the life-course implications of cancer incidence and survival, integrate secondary and self-report data, consider work neighborhood environments, and further develop analytical and statistical approaches appropriate to the geospatial and multilevel nature of the data. Incorporating social and built environment factors into research on cancer etiology and outcomes can provide insights into disease processes, identify vulnerable populations, and generate results with translational impact of relevance for interventionists and policy makers.",https://openalex.org/W1575144447,https://openalex.org/W1575144447
The Health Effects of Climate Change: A Survey of Recent Quantitative Research,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph9051523,Margherita Grasso; Matteo Manera; Aline Chiabai; Anil Markandya,2012,,"In recent years there has been a large scientific and public debate on climate change and its direct as well as indirect effects on human health. In particular, a large amount of research on the effects of climate changes on human health has addressed two fundamental questions. First, can historical data be of some help in revealing how short-run or long-run climate variations affect the occurrence of infectious diseases? Second, is it possible to build more accurate quantitative models which are capable of predicting the future effects of different climate conditions on the transmissibility of particularly dangerous infectious diseases? The primary goal of this paper is to review the most relevant contributions which have directly tackled those questions, both with respect to the effects of climate changes on the diffusion of non-infectious and infectious diseases, with malaria as a case study. Specific attention will be drawn on the methodological aspects of each study, which will be classified according to the type of quantitative model considered, namely time series models, panel data and spatial models, and non-statistical approaches. Since many different disciplines and approaches are involved, a broader view is necessary in order to provide a better understanding of the interactions between climate and health. In this respect, our paper also presents a critical summary of the recent literature related to more general aspects of the impacts of climate changes on human health, such as: the economics of climate change; how to manage the health effects of climate change; the establishment of Early Warning Systems for infectious diseases.",https://openalex.org/W1975386096,https://openalex.org/W1975386096
Poverty and Crime: Evidence from Rainfall and Trade Shocks in India,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2419522,Lakshmi Iyer; Petia Topalova,2014,,"Does poverty lead to crime? We shed light on this question using two independent and exogenous shocks to household income in rural India: the dramatic reduction in import tariffs in the early 1990s and rainfall variations. We find that trade shocks, previously shown to raise relative poverty, also increased the incidence of violent crimes and property crimes. The relationship between trade shocks and crime is similar to the observed relationship between rainfall shocks and crime. Our results thus identify a causal effect of poverty on crime. They also lend credence to a large literature on the effects of weather shocks on crime and conflict, which has usually assumed that the income channel is the most relevant one.",https://openalex.org/W1597246176,https://openalex.org/W1597246176

Hui,2020,,"Abstract Earth's tropical and subtropical rainbands, such as Intertropical Convergence Zones (ITCZs) and monsoons, are complex systems, governed by both large‐scale constraints on the atmospheric general circulation and regional interactions with continents and orography, and coupled to the ocean. Monsoons have historically been considered as regional large‐scale sea breeze circulations, driven by land‐sea contrast. More recently, a perspective has emerged of a global monsoon, a global‐scale solstitial mode that dominates the annual variation of tropical and subtropical precipitation. This results from the seasonal variation of the global tropical atmospheric overturning and migration of the associated convergence zone. Regional subsystems are embedded in this global monsoon, localized by surface boundary conditions. Parallel with this, much theoretical progress has been made on the fundamental dynamics of the seasonal Hadley cells and convergence zones via the use of hierarchical modeling approaches, including aquaplanets. Here we review the theoretical progress made and explore the extent to which these advances can help synthesize theory with observations to better understand differing characteristics of regional monsoons and their responses to certain forcings. After summarizing the dynamical and energetic balances that distinguish an ITCZ from a monsoon, we show that this theoretical framework provides strong support for the migrating convergence zone picture and allows constraints on the circulation to be identified via the momentum and energy budgets. Limitations of current theories are discussed, including the need for a better understanding of the influence of zonal asymmetries and transients on the large‐scale tropical circulation.",https://openalex.org/W3081331538,https://openalex.org/W3081331538
